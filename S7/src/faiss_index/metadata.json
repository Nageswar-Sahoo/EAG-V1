    "chunk": "Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players on a field, at the centre of which is a 22-yard (20-metre; 66-foot) pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails (small sticks) balanced on three stumps. Two players from the batting team, the striker and nonstriker, stand in front of either wicket holding bats, while one player from the fielding team, the bowler, bowls the ball toward the striker's wicket from the opposite end of the pitch. The striker's goal is to hit the bowled ball with the bat and then switch places with the nonstriker, with the batting team scoring one run for each of these exchanges. Runs are also scored when the ball reaches the boundary of the field or when the ball is bowled illegally. The fielding team aims to prevent runs by dismissing batters (so they are \"out\"). Dismissal can occur in various ways, including being bowled (when the ball hits the striker's wicket and dislodges the bails), and by the fielding side either catching the ball after it is hit by the bat but before it hits the ground, or hitting a wicket with the ball before a batter can cross the crease line in front of the wicket. When ten batters have been dismissed, the innings (playing phase) ends and the teams swap roles. Forms of cricket range from traditional Test matches played over five days to the newer Twenty20 format (also known as T20), in which each team bats for a single innings",

    "chunk": "the innings (playing phase) ends and the teams swap roles. Forms of cricket range from traditional Test matches played over five days to the newer Twenty20 format (also known as T20), in which each team bats for a single innings of 20 overs (each \"over\" being a set of 6 fair opportunities for the batting team to score) and the game generally lasts three to four hours. Traditionally, cricketers play in all-white kit, but in limited overs cricket, they wear club or team colours. In addition to the basic kit, some players wear protective gear to prevent injury caused by the ball, which is a hard, solid spheroid made of compressed leather with a slightly raised sewn seam enclosing a cork core layered with tightly wound string. The earliest known definite reference to cricket is to it being played in South East England in the mid-16th century. It spread globally with the expansion of the British Empire, with the first international matches in the second half of the 19th century. The game's governing body is the International Cricket Council (ICC), which has over 100 members, twelve of which are full members who play Test matches. The game's rules, the Laws of Cricket, are maintained by Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in London. The sport is followed primarily in South Asia, Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, Southern Africa, and the West Indies.

    "chunk": "DLF Limited (formerly Delhi Land & Finance) is an Indian commercial real estate development company. It was founded by Chaudhary Raghvendra Singh in 1946, and it is based in New Delhi, India.[2][3] DLF has developed residential colonies in Delhi such as Model Town, Rajouri Garden, Krishna Nagar, South Extension, Greater Kailash, Kailash Colony, and Hauz Khas. DLF builds residential, office, and retail properties.[4][5] With the passage of the Delhi Development Act in 1957, the local government assumed control of real estate development and banned private real estate developers from Delhi proper. As a result, DLF began acquiring land at a relatively low cost outside the area controlled by the Delhi Development Authority, in the district of Gurgaon, and in the adjacent state of Haryana. In the mid-1970s, the company started developing their DLF City project at Gurgaon. This included hotels, infrastructure, and special economic zones-related development projects. The company is headed by Rajiv Singh, who is the current chairman of the DLF Group. According to the Forbes listing of richest billionaires in 2023, Kushal Pal Singh, Chairman Emeritus, is the 19th richest man in India with a net worth of US$8.8 billion. The company's $US$2 billion IPO in July 2007 was India's biggest IPO in history.[6] In its first quarter results for the period ending 30 June 2007, the company reported a turnover of \u20b931.2098 billion (US$360 million) and profit after taxes of \u20b915.1548 billion (US$180 million).[7] As of 31 March 2012, the company had 1,380 square feet of leased retail space across the country.[8] In",

Subsequently, the company developed 21 colonies in Delhi, including Model Town, Rajouri Garden, Punjabi Bagh, South Extension, Greater Kailash, Kailash Colony and Hauz Khas. The passage of Delhi Development Act in 1957 was the first serious challenge to company's growth. The Act meant that the government would assume control of all real estate development activities in the city.[11] As a result, DLF decided to move beyond Delhi and focused on the suburb of Gurgaon in Haryana,[12] which had the potential for development of residential and commercial properties. As DLF started to acquire land under the leadership of Chairman K.P. Singh, Gurgaon embarked on a period of rapid growth.[13] A \u20b958 crore deal was cancelled between DLF and Robert Vadra by IAS officer Ashok Khemka.[14] Sponsorship In 2008, DLF became the title sponsor of the Indian Premier League, a newly formed Twenty20 cricket league. DLF paid close to \u20b92 billion (US$23 million) for the five-year sponsorship deal.[15] The deal ended in the 2012 version of the season, wherein it was taken over by Pepsi.

Beyond buildings Haryana Urban Development Authority (HUDA) and DLF, in a 50:50 joint venture, have completed work on a 16-lane, 10.5 km road network in Gurgaon. This stretch from NH8 Toll Plaza to Sector 55/56 in Gurgaon with six underpasses, one flyover and freeways has improved traffic management in the city.[16] To create this infrastructure facility, DLF had engaged Parsons Brinckerhoff for project management consultancy and construction work had been awarded to IL&FS.[17] Controversies In August 2011, a penalty of \u20b96.3 billion (US$74 million) was imposed on DLF by the Competition Commission of India (CCI)[18] after finding DLF guilty of breaching laws regarding the unfair pricing of goods and services. The complaint was lodged against DLF by buyers in its residential projects Belaire & Park Place, located in Gurgaon.[19] In February 2015, the CCI ordered its investigative arm to probe two more projects of DLF in Gurgaon, namely, DLF Regal Gardens[20] and DLF Skycourt.[21][22] DLF land grab case pertains to the alleged illegal acquisition of 50 acres of land in Amipur village, Haryana, back in 2013, during Bhupinder Singh Hooda's tenure as Chief Minister under the Congress government. This matter has led to an investigation by the Central Bureau of Investigation involving Robert Vadra, Bhupinder Singh Hooda, and the DLF, as of around December 2017.[23]",

The rationale for the downgrade as per the press release issued by ICRA is extracted below: \u201cThe ratings for the bank facilities of Gensol Engineering Limited (GEL) have been downgraded to [ICRA]D following feedback received by ICRA from the company\u2019s lenders about the ongoing delays in debt servicing.

In respect of these two lenders (PFC and IREDA), Gensol shared Conduct Letters purportedly issued by IREDA and PFC, which stated that Gensol was regular in its debt servicing. 18.

This position is corroborated by Go-Auto Private Limited (Go-Auto), the stated supplier of the EVs, which confirmed that it sold 4,704 EVs to the Company for a total consideration of Rs. 567.73 Crore. 27. However, records show that the company received loans aggregating Rs. 663.89 Crore for the stated purpose from IREDA and PFC. Gensol was to provide an additional equity (margin) contribution of 20%, bringing the total expected deployment of approximately Rs. 829.86 Crore for the purchase of 6,400 Electric Vehicles.

It can be noted from the above that funds availed by Gensol as loans for procuring EVs were, through layered transactions, partly utilised for buying a high-end apartment in The Camellias, DLF Gurgoan, in the name of a firm where the MD of Gensol and his brother are designated partners. 37. It was separately noted that the Rs. 5 Crore which was initially paid as booking advance by Jasminder Kaur, mother of Anmol Singh Jaggi, was also sourced from Gensol. Further, it was noted that once DLF returned the advance to Jasminder Kaur, the funds did not go back to the Company but were instead credited to another related party of Gensol viz. Matrix Gas and Renewables Ltd. (Matrix). The fund flow, as per the bank statements, is shown below: Movement of funds from Gensol to DLF Limited while booking apartment Movement of",

From the above analysis of the utilization of funds (loans) received by Gensol from IREDA and PFC, it prima-facie appears that the Company grossly mis- utilized funds and also diverted certain funds to the promoter/promoter-related entities. While the Company was to have spent an amount of Rs. 829.86 Crore (including promoter contribution) for buying EVs, bank statement analysis showed that it had transferred Rs. 775 Crore to Go-Auto against which it has obtained delivery of 4,704 EVs costing Rs. 567.73 Crore. 55. Ajay Agarwal, Managing Director of Go-Auto, in his statement recorded before SEBI on March 24, 2025, deposed that an amount of around Rs. 50 Crore was due from Gensol and therefore, Go-Auto would not be delivering anymore EVs to Gensol. 56.

It was noted that the Company had made a disclosure dated January 28, 2025, to the exchanges that it had received pre-orders for 30,000 of its newly launched electric vehicles unveiled at the Bharat Mobility Global Expo 2025. However, when relevant documents were called for from the Company and examined it was noted that the Orders in question were Memorandum of Understandings (MOUs) entered with 9 entities for 29,000 cars. The MOUs were in the nature of an expression of willingness with no reference to the price of the vehicle or delivery schedules.

It was noted that the said US Subsidiary was incorporated on July 22, 2024. When probed by SEBI regarding the basis of such valuation of Rs.350 Crore, Gensol has failed to submit any explanation / rationale. Pledge of Shares made by Promoters to IREDA 85. As mentioned in para 6 above, the shareholding of the promoters of Gensol had come down to 35.125% as of March 31, 2025. The promoters now hold 1,33,48,359 shares in the Company. 86. We have been informed by IREDA vide email dated April 11, 2025 that promoters have created pledges for 75.74 Lakh shares of Gensol.

The promoters were running a listed public company as if it were a propriety firm.

The diversion of funds of the Company by promoter entities reflects a culture of weak internal control, where even ring-fenced borrowings from institutional creditors were rerouted at the total discretion of the promoters. The internal controls at Gensol appear to be loose and through the quick layering of transactions, funds have seamlessly flowed to multiple related entities/individuals. 92.

Important Breaking changes between 0.0.1 to 0.1.0: * Dependencies are now organized into optional feature-groups (further details below). Use `pip install 'markitdown[all]'` to have backward-compatible behavior. * convert\\_stream() now requires a binary file-like object (e.g., a file opened in binary mode, or an io.BytesIO object). This is a breaking change from the previous version, where it previously also accepted text file-like objects, like io.StringIO. * The DocumentConverter class interface has changed to read from file-like streams rather than file paths. _No temporary files are created anymore_. If you are the maintainer of a plugin, or custom DocumentConverter, you likely need to update your code.

At present, MarkItDown supports: * PDF * PowerPoint * Word * Excel * Images (EXIF metadata and OCR) * Audio (EXIF metadata and speech transcription) * HTML * Text-based formats (CSV, JSON, XML) * ZIP files (iterates over contents) * Youtube URLs * EPubs * ... and more! Why Markdown? ------------- [](#why-markdown) Markdown is extremely close to plain text, with minimal markup or formatting, but still provides a way to represent important document structure. Mainstream LLMs, such as OpenAI's GPT-4o, natively \"_speak_\" Markdown, and often incorporate Markdown into their responses unprompted. This suggests that they have been trained on vast amounts of Markdown-formatted text, and understand it well. As a side benefit, Markdown conventions are also highly token-efficient. Installation ------------ [](#installation) To install MarkItDown, use pip: `pip install 'markitdown[all]'`. Alternatively, you can install it from the source: ``` git clone git@github.com:microsoft/markitdown.git cd markitdown pip install -e 'packages/markitdown[all]' ``` Usage ----- [](#usage) ### Command-Line [](#command-line) ``` markitdown path-to-file.pdf > document.md ``` Or use `-o` to specify the output file: ``` markitdown path-to-file.pdf -o document.md ``` You can also pipe content: ``` cat path-to-file.pdf | markitdown ``` ### Optional Dependencies [](#optional-dependencies) MarkItDown has optional dependencies for activating various file formats.

In its annual report for 2012, the company summarizes its business operations: We design, develop, manufacture and sell high-performance fully electric vehicles and advanced electric vehicle powertrain components. We own our sales and service network and have operationally structured our business in a manner that we believe will enable us to rapidly develop and launch advanced electric vehicles and technologies. We believe our vehicles, electric vehicle engineering expertise, and operational structure differentiates us from incumbent automobile manufacturers. We are the first company to commercially produce a federally-compliant electric vehicle, the Tesla Roadster, which achieves a market-leading range on a single charge combined with attractive design, driving performance and zero tailpipe emissions. As of December 31, 2012, we had delivered approximately 2,450 Tesla Roadsters to customers in over 30 countries. While we have concluded the production run of the Tesla Roadster, its proprietary electric vehicle powertrain system is the foundation of our business. We modified this system for our Model S sedan and plan to continue to enhance it for use in our future electric vehicles, including our Model X crossover. 1 The company notes that \u2018the commercial production of a highway capable, fully electric vehicle that",

Our success depends, at least in part, on our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property. To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of patents, patent applications, trade secrets, including know-how, employee and third party nondisclosure agreements, copyright laws, trademarks, intellectual property licenses and other contractual rights to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our technology.

Prizes are one thing, but when the rubber hits the proverbial road, unit sales are what matter in the auto industry.

He has also emphasized the combination of big data and fast product development: The difference between the value of Tesla\u2019s electric miles and GM\u2019s gasoline miles has to do with data. Think of an electric vehicle as a mobile computer. Electric Vehicles generate vast amounts of data. A car company sifting through this data can learn and adapt far more quickly than a company without user data. A car company that collects data about its cars can understand customer usage patterns and technology stresses and failures. It can quickly fix mistakes, download new software to the cars, and develop new products and services. The electric vehicle product development process is shortened; it resembles the computer industry\u2019s ultra-fast development cycles.

The increased demand from solar and wind increases the scale of existing Li-on providers, which in turn pushes down the cost of electric vehicles, solar, and wind. The increasing demand for electric vehicles and solar will attract even more investment in these technologies. Innovative companies that can invent new ways to push costs down and push quality up will thrive. This virtuous cycle of increasing demand, increasing investment, and increasing innovation will dramatically lower costs; it will exponentially improve the quality benefits to both the clean energy and clean transportation industries; it will also lead to a convergence in which batteries can be used for transportation and grid storage. Electric vehicles can be charged at work and become a source as well as a user of energy for the home. The result will be a swift transition from liquid-energy transportation to electric transportation.109 Seba admits that \u2018an electric vehicle is still more expensive to purchase upfront, mainly due to battery costs\u2019.110 He predicts that \u2018like other technology products, the technology cost curve of electric vehicles points to a disruption soon; innovative business models will only accelerate the transition from gasoline to electric vehicles.\u2019111 It is certainly notable that Elon Musk has investments in both electric cars and solar energy.

Elon Musk has certainly shown a Steve Jobs-like elan and bravura at salesmanship and promotion. The company Tesla Motors has also been involved in battles over other forms of intellectual property \u2014 most notably, in respect of trade marks relating to the United States,145 and China.146 It is striking that the company has not espoused an open source philosophy when it comes to trade mark law.

In China, Tesla Motors encountered a number of troubles in respect of trademark law.152 Professor Eric Lane from Thomas Jefferson School of Law has been following the longstanding conflict, and has provided a useful summary of the dispute: As it sought to expand into the Chinese market, the electric car maker encountered a businessman named Zhan Baosheng who owned registrations for the TESLA (or \u201cTe Si La\u201d transliterated) trademark in China in both English and Chinese. While Zhan\u2019s trademark rights initially blocked Tesla from using the mark there, in early 2014 the company announced that it had resolved the matter though a court decision granting it the right to use the TESLA mark in China.

We need farmers to help grow them. We need engineers to invent new technologies. We need entrepreneurs to sell those technologies. We need workers to operate assembly lines that hum with high-tech, zero-carbon components. We need builders to hammer into place the foundations for a clean energy age. We need diplomats and businessmen and women, and Peace Corps volunteers to help developing nations skip past the dirty phase of development and transition to sustainable sources of energy.177 177 President Barack Obama, \u2018Remarks by the President at the University of California-Irvine Commencement Ceremony\u2019, The White House, 14 June 2014, http://www.dailykos.com/story/2014/06/14/1307018/-President-Obama-s-remarks-at-UC-Irvine- commencement-ceremony 45 Obama recommended greater investment in renewable energy, and divestment from fossil fuels: \u2018You need to invest in what helps, and divest from what harms.\u2019178 He observed: \u2018You\u2019ve got to remind everyone who represents you, at every level of government, that doing something about climate change is a prerequisite for your vote.\u2019179 It remains to be seen whether Elon Musk\u2019s gift of patents will help President Barack",

B. Gigafactory In February 2014, Tesla Motors announced its ambition to establish a Gigafactory: As we at Tesla reach for our goal of producing a mass market electric car in approximately three years, we have an opportunity to leverage our projected demand for lithium ion batteries to reduce their cost faster than previously thought possible. In cooperation with strategic battery manufacturing partners, we\u2019re planning to build a large scale factory that will allow us to achieve economies of scale and minimize costs through innovative manufacturing, reduction of logistics waste, optimization of co-located processes and reduced overhead. The Gigafactory is designed to reduce cell costs much faster than the status quo and, by 2020, produce more lithium ion batteries annually than were produced worldwide in 2013. By the end of the first year of volume production of our mass market vehicle, we expect the Gigafactory will have driven down the per kWh cost of our battery pack by more than 30 percent.180 178 179 180 Ibid.

What we are trying to address is not the lay of the land today, where there are indeed too many suppliers, most of whom are producing relatively low photonic efficiency solar cells at uncompelling costs, but how we see the future developing. Without decisive action to lay the groundwork today, the massive volume of affordable, high efficiency panels needed for unsubsidized solar power to outcompete fossil fuel grid power simply will not be there when it is needed. SolarCity was founded to accelerate mass adoption of sustainable energy. The sun, that highly convenient and free fusion reactor in the sky, radiates more energy to the Earth in a few hours than the entire human population consumes from all sources in a year. This means that solar panels, paired with batteries to enable power at night, can produce several orders of magnitude more electricity than is consumed by the entirety of human civilization. A cogent assessment of sustainable energy potential from various sources is described well in this Sandia paper:www.sandia.gov/~jytsao/Solar%20FAQs.pdf. Even if the solar industry were only to generate 40 percent of the world\u2019s electricity with photovoltaics by 2040, that would mean installing more than 400 GW of solar capacity per year for the next 25 years.

The plans we are announcing today, while substantial compared to current industry, are small in that context.196 There has been much debate about whether this strategy of SolarCity will be successful. More generally, there has been a great optimism about the widespread adoption and diffusion of solar photovoltaics.

The Maldives is southwest of Sri Lanka and India, about 750 kilometres (470 miles; 400 nautical miles) from the Asian continent's mainland. The Maldives' chain of 26 atolls stretches across the equator from Ihavandhippolhu Atoll in the north to Addu Atoll in the south. The Maldives is the smallest country in Asia. Its land area is only 298 square kilometres (115 sq mi), but this is spread over roughly 90,000 square kilometres (35,000 sq mi) of the sea, making it one of the world's most spatially dispersed sovereign states. With a population of 515,132 in the 2022 census, it is the second least populous country in Asia and the ninth-smallest country by area, but also one of the most densely populated countries. The Maldives has an average ground-level elevation of 1.5 metres (4 ft 11 in) above sea level,[10] and a highest natural point of only 2.4 metres (7 ft 10 in), making it the world's lowest-lying country. Some sources state the highest point, Mount Villingili, as 5.1 metres or 17 feet.[10] Mal\u00e9 is the capital and the most populated city, traditionally called the \"King's Island\", where the ancient royal dynasties ruled from its central location.[11] The Maldives has been inhabited for over 2,500 years.

Documented contact with the outside world began around 947 AD when Arab travelers began visiting the islands. In the 12th century, partly due to the importance of the Arabs and Persians as traders in the Indian Ocean, Islam reached the Maldivian Archipelago.[12] The Maldives was soon consolidated as a sultanate, developing strong commercial and cultural ties with Asia and Africa. From the mid-16th century, the region came under the increasing influence of European colonial powers, with the Maldives becoming a British protectorate in 1887. Independence from the United Kingdom came in 1965, and a presidential republic was established in 1968 with an elected People's Majlis. The ensuing decades have seen political instability, efforts at democratic reform,[13] and environmental challenges posed by climate change and rising sea levels.[14] The Maldives became a founding member of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC). The Maldives is a member of the United Nations, the Commonwealth of Nations, the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, and the Non-Aligned Movement. The World Bank classifies the Maldives as having an upper-middle income economy.[15] The Maldives is a Dialogue Partner of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation.[16] Fishing has historically been the dominant economic activity, and remains the largest sector by far, followed by the rapidly growing tourism industry.

The Maldives rates \"high\" on the Human Development Index,[17] with per capita income significantly higher than other SAARC nations.[18] The Maldives was a member of the Commonwealth of Nations from July 1982 until withdrawing from the organisation in October 2016 in protest of allegations of its human rights abuses and failing democracy.[19] The Maldives rejoined the Commonwealth on 1 February 2020 after showing evidence of functioning democratic processes and popular support.[20] Etymology See also: Names of the Maldives According to legends, the first settlers of the Maldives were people known as Dheyvis.[21] The first Kingdom of the Maldives was known as Kingdom of Dheeva Maari [bn].[22] During the 3rd century BCE visit of emissaries, it was noted that the Maldives was known as Dheeva Mahal.[21] During c. 1100 \u2013 1166, the Maldives was also referred to as Diva Kudha, and the Laccadive archipelago which was a part of the Maldives was then referred to as Diva Kanbar by the scholar and polymath al-Biruni.[23] The name Maldives may also derive from Sanskrit \u092e\u093e\u0932\u093e m\u0101l\u0101 (garland) and \u0926\u094d\u0935\u0940\u092a dv\u012bpa (island),[24] or \u0db8\u0dcf\u0dbd \u0daf\u0dd2\u0dc0\u0dba\u0dd2\u0db1 Maala Divaina (\"Necklace Islands\") in Sinhala.[25] The Maldivian people are called Dhivehin. The word Dheeb/Deeb (archaic Dhivehi, related to Sanskrit \u0926\u094d\u0935\u0940\u092a, dv\u012bpa) means \"island\", and Dhives (Dhivehin) means \"islanders\" (i.e., Maldivians).[26] In Tamil, \"Garland of Islands\" can be translated as M\u0101lait\u012bvu (\u0bae\u0bbe\u0bb2\u0bc8\u0ba4\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0bc0\u0bb5\u0bc1).[27] The venerable Sri Lankan chronicle",

Jan Hogendorn, professor of economics at Colby College, theorised that the name Maldives derives from the Sanskrit m\u0101l\u0101dv\u012bpa (\u092e\u093e\u0932\u093e\u0926\u094d\u0935\u0940\u092a), meaning \"garland of islands\".[24] In Malayalam, \"Garland of Islands\" can be translated as Maladweepu (\u0d2e\u0d3e\u0d32\u0d26\u0d4d\u0d35\u0d40\u0d2a\u0d4d).[28] In Kannada, \"Garland of Islands\" can be translated as Maaledweepa (\u0cae\u0cbe\u0cb2\u0cc6\u0ca6\u0ccd\u0cb5\u0cc0\u0caa).[29] None of these names are mentioned in any literature, however, classical Sanskrit texts dating back to the Vedic period mention the \"Hundred Thousand Islands\" (Lakshadweepa), a generic name which would include not only the Maldives, but also the Laccadives, Aminidivi Islands, Minicoy, and the Chagos island groups.[30][31] Medieval Muslim travellers such as Ibn Battuta called the islands Ma\u1e25al D\u012bb\u012by\u0101t (\u0645\u062d\u0644 \u062f\u064a\u0628\u064a\u0629) from the Arabic word ma\u1e25al (\"palace\"), which must be how the Berber traveller interpreted the name of Mal\u00e9, having been through Muslim North India, where Perso-Arabic words were introduced to the local vocabulary.[32] This is the name currently inscribed on the scroll in the Maldives state emblem.[1] The classical Persian/Arabic name for the Maldives is Dibajat.[33][34] The Dutch referred to the islands as the Maldivische Eilanden (pronounced [m\u0251l\u02c8divis\u0259 \u02c8\u0294\u025bil\u0251nd\u0259(n)]),[35] while the British anglicised the local name for the islands first to the \"Maldive Islands\" and",

In the Malabar language, nale means four, and diva means island. So that in that language, the word signifies 'four islands', while we, corrupting the name, call it Maldiva.\"[36] The local name for Maldives by the Maldivian people in Dhivehi language is \"Dhivehi Raajje\", (Dhivehi: \u078b\u07a8\u0788\u07ac\u0780\u07a8\u0783\u07a7\u0787\u07b0\u0796\u07ac).[37] History Main article: History of the Maldives Ancient history and settlement Main article: History of the Maldives \u00a7 Early Age In the 6th\u20135th century BCE, the Maldives already had their kingdoms.[21] The country has an established history of over 2,500 years according to historical evidence and legends.[38] The Mah\u0101va\u1e43sa (300 BCE) has records of people from Sri Lanka emigrating to the Maldives.[21] Assuming that cowrie shells come from the Maldives, historians believe that there may have been people living in the Maldives during the Indus Valley civilisation (3300\u20131300 BCE).[39] Several artefacts show the presence of Hinduism in the country before the Islamic period.[21] According to the book Kit\u0101b fi \u0101th\u0101r M\u012bdhu al-q\u0101dimah (\u0643\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u0641\u064a \u0622\u062b\u0627\u0631 \u0645\u064a\u0630\u0648 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u062f\u064a\u0645\u0629) (On the Ancient Ruins of Meedhoo), written in the 17th century in Arabic by Allama Ahmed Shihabuddine (Allama Shihab",

Shihabuddin's story tallies remarkably well with the recorded history of South Asia and that of the copperplate document of the Maldives known as Loamaafaanu.[21] The ancient history of the Maldives is told in copperplates, ancient scripts carved on coral artefacts, traditions, language, and different ethnicities of Maldivians.[21] The Maapanansa,[21] the copper plates on which were recorded the history of the first Kings of the Maldives from the Solar Dynasty, were lost quite early on. A 4th-century notice written by Ammianus Marcellinus (362 CE) speaks of gifts sent to the Roman emperor Julian by a deputation from the nation of Divi. The name Divi is very similar to Dheyvi who were the first settlers of Maldives.[21] The first Maldivians did not leave any archaeological artefacts. Their buildings were probably built of wood, palm fronds, and other perishable materials, which would have quickly decayed in the salt and wind of the tropical climate. Moreover, chiefs or headmen did not reside in elaborate stone palaces, nor did their religion require the construction of large temples or compounds.[40] Comparative",

Despite being just mentioned briefly in most history books, the 1,400 year-long Buddhist period has a foundational importance in the history of the Maldives. It was during this period that the culture of the Maldives both developed and flourished, a culture that survives today. The Maldivian language, early Maldive scripts, architecture, ruling institutions, customs, and manners of the Maldivians originated at the time when the Maldives were a Buddhist kingdom.[44] Buddhism probably spread to the Maldives in the 3rd century BCE at the time of Emperor Ashoka's expansion and became the dominant religion of the people of the Maldives until the 12th century. Archeological evidence from an ancient Buddhist monastery in Kaashidhoo has been dated between 205 and 560 AD, based on the radiocarbon dating of shell deposits unearthed from the foundations of stupas and other structures in the monastery.[45] The ancient Maldivian Kings promoted Buddhism, and the first Maldive writings and artistic achievements, in the form of highly developed sculpture and architecture, originate from that period. Nearly all archaeological remains in the Maldives are from Buddhist stupas and monasteries, and all artefacts found to date display characteristic Buddhist iconography.[citation needed] Islamic period See also: History of the Maldives \u00a7 Islamic Period, Islam in Maldives, List of Maldivian monarchs, and Sultanate of Maldives The",

Adopting the Muslim title of Sultan Muhammad al-Adil, he initiated a series of six Islamic dynasties that lasted until 1932 when the sultanate became elective. The formal title of the sultan up to 1965 was, Sultan of Land and Sea, Lord of the twelve-thousand islands and Sultan of the Maldives which came with the style Highness. A Moroccan traveller named Abu al-Barakat Yusuf al-Barbari is traditionally cited for this conversion.[46] According to the story told to Ibn Battutah, a mosque was built with the inscription: 'The Sultan Ahmad Shanurazah accepted Islam at the hand of Abu al-Barakat Yusuf al-Barbari.'[46][47] Some scholars have suggested the possibility of Ibn Battuta misreading Maldive texts, and having a bias towards the North African, Maghrebi narrative of this Shaykh, instead of the Persian origins account that was known as well at the time.[48] Others have it that he may have been from the Persian town of Tabriz.[49] This interpretation, held by the more reliable local historical chronicles, Raadavalhi and Taarikh,[50][51] is that Abu al-Barakat Yusuf al-Barbari was Abdul Barakat Yusuf Shams ud-D\u012bn at-Tabr\u012bz\u012b, also locally known",

The British expelled the Dutch from Ceylon in 1796 and included the Maldives as a British protectorate. The status of the Maldives as a British protectorate was officially recorded in an 1887 agreement in which the sultan Muhammad Mueenuddeen II accepted British influence over Maldivian external relations and defence while retaining home rule, which continued to be regulated by Muslim traditional institutions in exchange for an annual tribute.

In Addu Atoll, the westernmost islands are connected by roads over the reef (collectively called Link Road), and the total length of the road is 14 km (9 mi). The Maldives is the lowest country in the world, with maximum and average natural ground levels of only 2.4 metres (7 ft 10 in) and 1.5 metres (4 ft 11 in) above sea level, respectively. In areas where construction exists, however, this has been increased to several metres. More than 80 percent of the country's land is composed of coral islands which rise less than one metre above sea level.[94] As a result, the Maldives are in danger of being submerged due to rising sea levels. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has warned that, at current rates, sea-level rise would be high enough to make the Maldives uninhabitable by 2100.[95][96] Climate A beach of Bathala island The Maldives has a tropical monsoon climate (Am) under the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, which is affected by the large landmass of South Asia to the north. Because the Maldives has the lowest elevation of any country in the world, the temperature is constantly hot and often humid. The presence of this landmass causes differential heating of land and water. These factors set off a rush of moisture-rich air from the Indian Ocean over South Asia, resulting in the southwest monsoon. Two seasons dominate the Maldives' weather: the dry season associated with the winter northeastern monsoon and the rainy season associated with the southwest",

During this period, the southwest winds contribute to the formation of the southwest monsoon, which reaches the Maldives at the beginning of June and lasts until the end of November. However, the weather patterns of the Maldives do not always conform to the monsoon patterns of South Asia. The annual rainfall averages 254 centimetres (100 in) in the north and 381 centimetres (150 in) in the south.[98][97] The monsoonal influence is greater in the north of the Maldives than in the south, more influenced by the equatorial currents.

The purchase of land will be made from a fund generated by tourism. The president explained his intentions: \"We do not want to leave the Maldives, but we also do not want to be climate refugees living in tents for decades\".[104] At the 2009 International Climate Talks, Nasheed stated that: For us swearing off fossil fuels is not only the right thing to do, but it is also in our economic self-interest... Pioneering countries will free themselves from the unpredictable price of foreign oil; they will capitalise on the new green economy of the future, and they will enhance their moral standing giving them greater political influence on the world stage.[105] Former president Mohamed Nasheed said in 2012 \"If carbon emissions continue at the rate they are climbing today, my country will be underwater in seven years.\"[106] He has called for more climate change mitigation action while on the American television shows The Daily Show[107] and the",

The research also reported that sea walls were compromising islands' ability to adjust to rising sea levels and that island drowning is an inevitable outcome for islands with coastal structures like sea walls.[111] Hideki Kanamaru, natural resources officer with the Food and Agriculture Organization in Asia-Pacific, said the study provided a \"new perspective\" on how island nations could tackle the challenge of sea-level rise, and that even if islands can adapt naturally to higher seas by raising their own crests, humans still needed to double down on global warming and protection for island populations.[109] Environment Environmental issues other than sea level rise include bad waste disposal and sand theft.

This area of the Indian Ocean, alone, houses 1,100 species of fish, 5 species of sea turtle, 21 species of whale and dolphin, 400 species of mollusk, and 83 species of echinoderms. The area is also populated by several crustacean species: 120 copepods, and 15 amphipods, as well as more than 145 crab and 48 shrimp species.[114] Among the many marine families represented are pufferfish, fusiliers, jackfish, lionfish, oriental sweetlips, reef sharks, groupers, eels, snappers, bannerfish, batfish, humphead wrasse, spotted eagle rays, scorpionfish, lobsters, nudibranches, angelfish, butterflyfish, squirrelfish, soldierfish, glassfish, surgeonfish,",

Sponges have gained importance as five species have displayed anti-tumor and anti-cancer properties.[117] In 1998, sea-temperature warming of as much as 5 \u00b0C (9.0 \u00b0F) due to a single El Ni\u00f1o phenomenon event caused coral bleaching, killing two-thirds of the nation's coral reefs.[118] To induce the regrowth of the reefs, scientists placed electrified cones anywhere from 20\u201360 feet (6.1\u201318.3 m) below the surface to provide a substrate for larval coral attachment. In 2004, scientists witnessed corals regenerating. Corals began to eject pink-orange eggs and sperm. The growth of these electrified corals was five times faster than untreated corals.[118] Scientist Azeez Hakim stated: Before 1998, we never thought that this reef would die. We had always taken for granted that these animals would be there, that this reef would be there forever. El Ni\u00f1o gave us a wake-up call that these things are not going to be there forever.

Some reefs have been filled with rubble with little regard for the changes in the currents on the reef shelf and how the new pattern would affect coral growth and its related life forms on the reef edges.[122] Mangroves thrive in brackish or muddy regions of the Maldives.

Among the limited terrestrial reptilian inhabitants are a species of gecko and the oriental garden lizard (Calotes versicolor), alongside the white-spotted supple skink (Riopa albopunctata), the Indian wolf snake (Lycodon aulicus), and the brahmin blind snake (Ramphotyphlops braminus). In the surrounding seas, however, a more diverse array of reptilian life thrives. Maldivian beaches serve as nesting grounds for the green sea turtle (Chelonia mydas), the hawksbill sea turtle, and the leatherback sea turtle. Furthermore, saltwater crocodiles have been reported to occasionally reach the islands, taking residence in marshy regions.[125] The location of this Indian Ocean archipelago means that its avifauna is mainly restricted to pelagic birds.[126] Most of the species are Eurasian migratory birds, only a few being typically associated with the Indian sub-continent. Some, like the frigatebird, are seasonal. Some birds dwell in marshes and island bush, like the grey heron and the moorhen.

The Coast Guard is also assigned to respond to maritime distress calls and to conduct search and rescue operations promptly. In 2019, the Maldives signed the UN treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.[158] Human rights Main article: Human rights in the Maldives Human rights in the Maldives is a contentious issue. In its 2011 Freedom in the World report, Freedom House declared the Maldives \"Partly Free\", claiming a reform process that had made headway in 2009 and 2010 had stalled.[159] The United States Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor claims in their 2012 report on human rights practices in the country that the most significant problems are corruption, lack of religious freedom, abuse, and unequal treatment of women.[160] Administrative divisions Main article: Administrative divisions of the Maldives Each administrative atoll is marked, along with the thaana letter used to identify the atoll.

The islands are administered by an elected Island Council. In addition to a name, every administrative division is identified by the Maldivian code letters, such as \"Haa Alif\" for Thiladhunmati Uthuruburi (Thiladhunmathi North); and by a Latin code letter. The first corresponds to the geographical Maldivian name of the atoll; the second is a code adopted for convenience. As certain islands in different atolls have the same name, for administrative purposes this code is quoted before the name of the island, for example: Baa Funadhoo, Kaafu Funadhoo, Gaafu-Alifu Funadhoo. Since most atolls have very long geographical names it is also used whenever the long name is inconvenient, for example in the atoll website names.[162] The introduction of code-letter names has been a source of much puzzlement and misunderstanding, especially among foreigners. Many people have come to think that the code letter of the administrative atoll is its new name and that it has replaced its geographical name. Under such circumstances, it is hard to know which is the correct name to use.[162] Economy Main article: Economy of the Maldives Mal\u00e9 harbour Historically, the Maldives provided enormous quantities of cowry shells, an international currency of the early ages.

From the 2nd century CE, the islands were known as the 'Money Isles' by the Arabs.[163] Monetaria moneta was used for centuries as a currency in Africa, and huge amounts of Maldivian cowries were introduced into Africa by western nations during the period of slave trade.[164] The cowry is now the symbol of the Maldives Monetary Authority. In the early 1970s and 1980s, the Maldives was one of the world's 20 poorest countries, with a population of 100,000.[165] The economy at the time was largely dependent on fisheries and trading local goods such as coir rope, ambergris (Maavaharu), and coco de mer (Tavakkaashi) with neighbouring countries and East Asian countries.[166] The Maldivian government began a largely successful economic reform programme in the 1980s, initiated by lifting import quotas and giving more opportunities to the private sector. At that time, the tourism sector was in its infant stage but would later play a significant role in the nation's development. Agriculture and manufacturing continue to play lesser roles in the economy, constrained by the limited availability of cultivable land and the shortage of domestic labour.

Only 200 islands are home to its 382,751 inhabitants.[167][168] The other islands are used entirely for economic purposes, of which tourism and agriculture are the most dominant. Tourism accounts for 28% of the GDP and more than 60% of the Maldives' foreign exchange receipts. Over 90% of government tax revenue comes from import duties and tourism-related taxes. The development of tourism fostered the overall growth of the country's economy. It created direct and indirect employment and income generation opportunities in other related industries. The first tourist resorts were opened in 1972 with Bandos Island Resort and Kurumba Village (the current name is Kurumba Maldives),[169] which transformed the Maldives' economy. The resort island of Landaa Giraavaru (Baa atoll) According to the Ministry of Tourism, the emergence of tourism in 1972 transformed the economy, moving rapidly from dependence on fisheries to tourism. In just three and a half decades, the industry became the main source of income. Tourism was also the country's biggest foreign currency earner and the single largest contributor to the GDP.

Fishing remains the main occupation of the people and the government gives priority to the fisheries sector. The mechanisation of the traditional fishing boat called dhoni in 1974 was a major milestone in the development of the fisheries industry. A fish canning plant was installed on Felivaru in 1977, as a joint venture with a Japanese firm. In 1979, a Fisheries Advisory Board was set up with the mandate of advising the government on policy guidelines for the overall development of the fisheries sector. Manpower development programmes began in the early 1980s, and fisheries education was incorporated into the school curriculum. Fish aggregating devices and navigational aids were located at various strategic points. Moreover, the opening up of the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of the Maldives for fisheries has further enhanced the growth of the fisheries sector.

In the past, there was also a small Tamil population known as the Giraavaru people. This group has now been almost completely absorbed into the larger Maldivian society but was once native to the island of Giraavaru, which was evacuated in 1968 due to heavy erosion of the island.[180] Some social stratification exists on the islands. It is not rigid, since rank is based on varied factors, including occupation, wealth, Islamic virtue, and family ties.

They were used until as recently as the 1980s for seeking the help of buried saints. They can be seen next to some old mosques and are considered a part of the Maldives's cultural heritage. Other aspects of tassawuf, such as ritualised dhikr ceremonies called Maul\u016bdu (Mawlid) \u2013 the liturgy of which included recitations and certain supplications in a melodic tone \u2013 existed until very recent times. These Maul\u016bdu festivals were held in ornate tents specially built for the occasion. At present Islam is the official religion of the entire population, as adherence to it is required for citizenship. According to Arab traveller Ibn Battuta, the person responsible for this conversion was a Sunni Muslim visitor named Abu al-Barakat Yusuf al-Barbari, sailing from what is today Morocco. He is also referred to as Tabrizugefaanu. His venerated tomb now stands on the grounds of Medhu Ziyaaraiy, across the street from the Friday Mosque, or Hukuru Miskiy, in Mal\u00e9.

The Maldives is southwest of Sri Lanka and India, about 750 kilometres (470 miles; 400 nautical miles) from the Asian continent's mainland. The Maldives' chain of 26 atolls stretches across the equator from Ihavandhippolhu Atoll in the north to Addu Atoll in the south. The Maldives is the smallest country in Asia. Its land area is only 298 square kilometres (115 sq mi), but this is spread over roughly 90,000 square kilometres (35,000 sq mi) of the sea, making it one of the world's most spatially dispersed sovereign states. With a population of 515,132 in the 2022 census, it is the second least populous country in Asia and the ninth-smallest country by area, but also one of the most densely populated countries. The Maldives has an average ground-level elevation of 1.5 metres (4 ft 11 in) above sea level,[10] and a highest natural point of only 2.4 metres (7 ft 10 in), making it the world's lowest-lying country. Some sources state the highest point, Mount Villingili, as 5.1 metres or 17 feet.[10] Mal\u00e9 is the capital and the most populated city, traditionally called",

Documented contact with the outside world began around 947 AD when Arab travelers began visiting the islands. In the 12th century, partly due to the importance of the Arabs and Persians as traders in the Indian Ocean, Islam reached the Maldivian Archipelago.[12] The Maldives was soon consolidated as a sultanate, developing strong commercial and cultural ties with Asia and Africa. From the mid-16th century, the region came under the increasing influence of European colonial powers, with the Maldives becoming a British protectorate in 1887. Independence from the United Kingdom came in 1965, and a presidential republic was established in 1968 with an elected People's Majlis. The ensuing decades have seen political instability, efforts at democratic reform,[13] and environmental challenges posed by climate change and rising sea levels.[14] The Maldives became a founding member of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC). The Maldives is a member of the United Nations, the Commonwealth of Nations, the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, and the Non-Aligned Movement.

The Maldives rates \"high\" on the Human Development Index,[17] with per capita income significantly higher than other SAARC nations.[18] The Maldives was a member of the Commonwealth of Nations from July 1982 until withdrawing from the organisation in October 2016 in protest of allegations of its human rights abuses and failing democracy.[19] The Maldives rejoined the Commonwealth on 1 February 2020 after showing evidence of functioning democratic processes and popular support.[20] Etymology See also: Names of the Maldives According to legends, the first settlers of the Maldives were people known as Dheyvis.[21] The first Kingdom of the Maldives was known as Kingdom of Dheeva Maari [bn].[22] During the 3rd century BCE visit of emissaries, it was noted that the Maldives was known as Dheeva Mahal.[21] During c. 1100 \u2013 1166, the Maldives was also referred to as Diva Kudha, and the Laccadive archipelago which was a part of the Maldives was then referred to as Diva Kanbar by the scholar and polymath al-Biruni.[23] The name Maldives may also derive from Sanskrit \u092e\u093e\u0932\u093e m\u0101l\u0101 (garland) and \u0926\u094d\u0935\u0940\u092a dv\u012bpa (island),[24] or \u0db8\u0dcf\u0dbd \u0daf\u0dd2\u0dc0\u0dba\u0dd2\u0db1 Maala Divaina (\"Necklace Islands\") in Sinhala.[25] The Maldivian people are called Dhivehin.

The word Dheeb/Deeb (archaic Dhivehi, related to Sanskrit \u0926\u094d\u0935\u0940\u092a, dv\u012bpa) means \"island\", and Dhives (Dhivehin) means \"islanders\" (i.e., Maldivians).[26] In Tamil, \"Garland of Islands\" can be translated as M\u0101lait\u012bvu (\u0bae\u0bbe\u0bb2\u0bc8\u0ba4\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0bc0\u0bb5\u0bc1).[27] The venerable Sri Lankan chronicle Mahavamsa mentions an island designated as Mahiladiva (\"Island of Women\", \u092e\u0939\u093f\u0932\u093e\u0926\u093f\u092d) in Pali, likely arising from an erroneous translation of the Sanskrit term, signifying \"garland\".

Shihabuddin's story tallies remarkably well with the recorded history of South Asia and that of the copperplate document of the Maldives known as Loamaafaanu.[21] The ancient history of the Maldives is told in copperplates, ancient scripts carved on coral artefacts, traditions, language, and different ethnicities of Maldivians.[21] The Maapanansa,[21] the copper plates on which were recorded the history of the first Kings of the Maldives from the Solar Dynasty, were lost quite early on. A 4th-century notice written by Ammianus Marcellinus (362 CE) speaks of gifts sent to the Roman emperor Julian by a deputation from the nation of Divi.

Despite being just mentioned briefly in most history books, the 1,400 year-long Buddhist period has a foundational importance in the history of the Maldives. It was during this period that the culture of the Maldives both developed and flourished, a culture that survives today. The Maldivian language, early Maldive scripts, architecture, ruling institutions, customs, and manners of the Maldivians originated at the time when the Maldives were a Buddhist kingdom.[44] Buddhism probably spread to the Maldives in the 3rd century BCE at the time of Emperor Ashoka's expansion and became the dominant religion of the people of the Maldives until the 12th century. Archeological evidence from an ancient Buddhist monastery in Kaashidhoo has been dated between 205 and 560 AD, based on the radiocarbon dating of shell deposits unearthed from the foundations of stupas and other structures in the monastery.[45] The ancient Maldivian Kings promoted Buddhism, and the first Maldive writings and artistic achievements, in the form of highly developed sculpture and architecture, originate from that period.

Adopting the Muslim title of Sultan Muhammad al-Adil, he initiated a series of six Islamic dynasties that lasted until 1932 when the sultanate became elective. The formal title of the sultan up to 1965 was, Sultan of Land and Sea, Lord of the twelve-thousand islands and Sultan of the Maldives which came with the style Highness. A Moroccan traveller named Abu al-Barakat Yusuf al-Barbari is traditionally cited for this conversion.[46] According to the story told to Ibn Battutah, a mosque was built with the inscription: 'The Sultan Ahmad Shanurazah accepted Islam at the hand of Abu al-Barakat Yusuf al-Barbari.'[46][47] Some scholars have suggested the possibility of Ibn Battuta misreading Maldive texts, and having a bias towards the North African, Maghrebi narrative of this Shaykh, instead of the Persian origins account that was known as well at the time.[48] Others have it that he may have been from the Persian town of Tabriz.[49] This interpretation,",

In the mid-17th century, the Dutch, who had replaced the Portuguese as the dominant power in Ceylon, established hegemony over Maldivian affairs without involving themselves directly in local matters, which were governed according to centuries-old Islamic customs. The British expelled the Dutch from Ceylon in 1796 and included the Maldives as a British protectorate. The status of the Maldives as a British protectorate was officially recorded in an 1887 agreement in which the sultan Muhammad Mueenuddeen II accepted British influence over Maldivian external relations and defence while retaining home rule, which continued to be regulated by Muslim traditional institutions in exchange for an annual tribute. The status of the islands was akin to other British protectorates in the Indian Ocean region, including Zanzibar and the Trucial States. 17th-century Portuguese drawing of the fortress of Maldives and the archipelago.

As a result, angry mobs were instigated against the Constitution which was publicly torn up. The Maldives remained a British crown protectorate until 1953 when the sultanate was suspended and the First Republic was declared under the short-lived presidency of Mohamed Amin Didi. While serving as prime minister during the 1940s, Didi nationalised the fish export industry. As president, he is remembered as a reformer of the education system and an advocate of women's rights. Conservatives in Mal\u00e9 ousted his government, and during a riot over food shortages, Didi was beaten by a mob and died on a nearby island.

After this, the sultanate continued for another three years under Sir Muhammad Fareed Didi, who declared himself King upon independence.[61] On 15 November 1967, a vote was taken in parliament to decide whether the Maldives should continue as a constitutional monarchy or become a republic.[62] Of the 44 members of parliament, 40 voted in favour of a republic. On 15 March 1968, a national referendum was held on the question, and 93.34% of those taking part voted in favour of establishing a republic.[63] The republic was declared on 11 November 1968, thus ending the 853-year-old monarchy, which was replaced by a republic under the presidency of Ibrahim Nasir.[64] As the King had held little real power, this was seen as a cosmetic change and required few alterations in the structures of government.

With support for his administration faltering, Nasir fled to Singapore in 1978, with millions of dollars from the treasury.[69] Maumoon Abdul Gayoom began his 30-year role as president in 1978, winning six consecutive elections without opposition. His election was seen as ushering in a period of political stability and economic development given Maumoon's priority to develop the poorer islands. Tourism flourished and increased foreign contact spurred development. However, Maumoon's rule was controversial, with some critics saying Maumoon was an autocrat who quelled dissent by limiting freedoms and practising political favouritism.[70] A series of coup attempts (in 1980, 1983, and 1988) by Nasir supporters and business interests tried to topple the government without success. While the first two attempts met with little success, the 1988 coup attempt involved a roughly 80-strong mercenary force of the PLOTE who seized the airport and caused Maumoon to flee from house to house until the intervention of 1,600 Indian troops airlifted into Mal\u00e9 restored order.

The tallest waves were reported to be 14 feet (4.3 m) high.[76] During the later part of Maumoon's rule, independent political movements emerged in the Maldives, which challenged the then-ruling Dhivehi Rayyithunge Party (Maldivian People's Party, MPP) and demanded democratic reform. The dissident journalist and activist Mohamed Nasheed founded the Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP) in 2003 and pressured Maumoon into allowing gradual political reforms.[77] In 2008, a new constitution was approved and the first direct presidential elections occurred, which were won by Nasheed in the second round. His administration faced many challenges, including the huge debt left by the previous government, the economic downturn following the 2004 tsunami, overspending using overprinting of local currency (the rufiyaa), unemployment, corruption, and increasing drug use.[78][unreliable source?] Taxation on goods was imposed for the first time in the country, and import duties were reduced on many goods and services.

The research also reported that sea walls were compromising islands' ability to adjust to rising sea levels and that island drowning is an inevitable outcome for islands with coastal structures like sea walls.[111] Hideki Kanamaru, natural resources officer with the Food and Agriculture Organization in Asia-Pacific, said the study provided a \"new perspective\" on how island nations could tackle the challenge of sea-level rise, and that even if islands can adapt naturally to higher seas by raising their own crests, humans still needed to double down on global warming and protection for island populations.[109] Environment Environmental issues other",

Although the Maldives are kept relatively pristine and little litter can be found on the islands, most waste disposal sites are often substandard. The bulk of the waste from Mal\u00e9 and nearby resorts in the Maldives is disposed of at Thilafushi, an industrial island on top of a lagoon reclaimed in the early '90s to sort waste management issues which had plagued the capital and surrounding islands.[112] 31 protected areas are administered by the Ministry of Climate Change, Environment and Energy and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) of the Maldives.[113] Marine ecosystem Further information: Wildlife of Maldives Maldives soft coral Oriental sweetlips (Plectorhinchus vittatus) at Meeru Island, North Male Atoll The Maldives have a range of different habitats including deep sea, shallow coast, and reef ecosystems, fringing mangroves, wetlands, and dry land.

Sponges have gained importance as five species have displayed anti-tumor and anti-cancer properties.[117] In 1998, sea-temperature warming of as much as 5 \u00b0C (9.0 \u00b0F) due to a single El Ni\u00f1o phenomenon event caused coral bleaching, killing two-thirds of the nation's coral reefs.[118] To induce the regrowth of the reefs, scientists placed electrified cones anywhere from 20\u201360 feet (6.1\u201318.3 m) below the surface to provide a substrate for larval coral attachment. In 2004, scientists witnessed corals regenerating. Corals began to eject pink-orange eggs and sperm. The growth of these electrified corals was five times faster than untreated corals.[118] Scientist Azeez Hakim stated: Before 1998, we never thought that this reef would die. We had always taken for granted that these animals would be there, that this reef would be there forever. El Ni\u00f1o gave us a wake-up call that these things are not going to be there forever.

Once seldom frequented, previously uninhabited islands now teeter on the brink of extinction, virtually devoid of untouched expanses. Over recent decades of intensive development, numerous natural environments crucial to indigenous species have suffered severe endangerment or outright destruction. Coral reef habitats have been damaged, as the pressure for land has brought about the creation of artificial islands. Some reefs have been filled with rubble with little regard for the changes in the currents on the reef shelf and how the new pattern would affect coral growth and its related life forms on the reef edges.[122] Mangroves thrive in brackish or muddy regions of the Maldives. The archipelago hosts fourteen species spanning ten genera, among which is the fern Acrostichum aureum, indigenous to these islands.[123] The waters surrounding the Maldives boast an extensive array of marine life, showcasing a vibrant tapestry of corals and over 2,000 species of fish.[124] From the dazzling hues of reef fish to the majestic presence of the blacktip reef shark, moray eels, and a diverse range of rays including manta rays, stingrays, and eagle rays, the seas teem with life.

Additionally, the introduction of the tilapia or mouth-breeder, facilitated by a United Nations agency in the 1970s, further enriches the aquatic diversity of the Maldives. Butorides striata in the Maldives Due to their diminutive size, land-dwelling reptiles are scarce on the Maldivian islands. Among the limited terrestrial reptilian inhabitants are a species of gecko and the oriental garden lizard (Calotes versicolor), alongside the white-spotted supple skink (Riopa albopunctata), the Indian wolf snake (Lycodon aulicus), and the brahmin blind snake (Ramphotyphlops braminus). In the surrounding seas, however, a more diverse array of reptilian life thrives. Maldivian beaches serve as nesting grounds for the green sea turtle (Chelonia mydas), the hawksbill sea turtle, and the leatherback sea turtle. Furthermore, saltwater crocodiles have been reported to occasionally reach the islands, taking residence in marshy regions.[125] The location of this Indian Ocean archipelago means that its avifauna is mainly restricted to pelagic birds.[126] Most of the species are Eurasian migratory birds, only a few being typically associated with the Indian sub-continent.

The islands are administered by an elected Island Council. In addition to a name, every administrative division is identified by the Maldivian code letters, such as \"Haa Alif\" for Thiladhunmati Uthuruburi (Thiladhunmathi North); and by a Latin code letter. The first corresponds to the geographical Maldivian name of the atoll; the second is a code adopted for convenience. As certain islands in different atolls have the same name, for administrative purposes this code is quoted before the name of the island, for example: Baa Funadhoo, Kaafu Funadhoo, Gaafu-Alifu Funadhoo. Since most atolls have very long geographical names it is also used whenever the long name is inconvenient, for example in the atoll website names.[162] The introduction of code-letter names has been a source of much puzzlement and misunderstanding, especially among foreigners.

Tourism accounts for 28% of the GDP and more than 60% of the Maldives' foreign exchange receipts. Over 90% of government tax revenue comes from import duties and tourism-related taxes. The development of tourism fostered the overall growth of the country's economy. It created direct and indirect employment and income generation opportunities in other related industries. The first tourist resorts were opened in 1972 with Bandos Island Resort and Kurumba Village (the current name is Kurumba Maldives),[169] which transformed the Maldives' economy. The resort island of Landaa Giraavaru (Baa atoll) According to the Ministry of Tourism, the emergence of tourism in 1972 transformed the economy, moving rapidly from dependence on fisheries to tourism.

A fish canning plant was installed on Felivaru in 1977, as a joint venture with a Japanese firm. In 1979, a Fisheries Advisory Board was set up with the mandate of advising the government on policy guidelines for the overall development of the fisheries sector. Manpower development programmes began in the early 1980s, and fisheries education was incorporated into the school curriculum. Fish aggregating devices and navigational aids were located at various strategic points. Moreover, the opening up of the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of the Maldives for fisheries has further enhanced the growth of the fisheries sector. As of 2010,",

They share the same culture and speak the Dhivehi language. They are principally an Indo-Aryan people, having traces of Middle Eastern, South Asian, Austronesian and African genes in the population. In the past, there was also a small Tamil population known as the Giraavaru people. This group has now been almost completely absorbed into the larger Maldivian society but was once native to the island of Giraavaru, which was evacuated in 1968 due to heavy erosion of the island.[180] Some social stratification exists on the islands. It is not rigid, since rank is based on varied factors, including occupation, wealth, Islamic virtue, and family ties.

Life expectancy in the Maldives The population doubled by 1978, and the population growth rate peaked at 3.4% in 1985. By the 2006 census, the population had reached 298,968,[181] although the census in 2000 showed that the population growth rate had declined to 1.9%. Life expectancy at birth stood at 46 years in 1978, and later rose to 72. Infant mortality has declined from 12.7% in 1977 to 1.2% today, and adult literacy reached 99%. Combined school enrolment reached the high 90s. The population was projected to have reached 317,280 in 2010.[182] The 2014 Population and Housing Census listed the total population in the Maldives as 437,535: 339,761 resident Maldivians and 97,774 resident foreigners, approximately 16% of the total population. However, it is believed that foreigners have been undercounted.[179][183] As of May 2021, there were 281,000 expatriate workers, an estimated 63,000 of whom are undocumented in the Maldives: 3,506 Chinese, 5,029 Nepalese, 15,670 Sri Lankans, 28,840 Indians, and (the largest group of foreigners working in the country) 112,588 Bangladeshis.[184][185][186] Other immigrants include Filipinos as well as various Western foreign workers.

Maldivians converted to Islam by the mid-12th century. The islands have had a long history of Sufic orders, as can be seen in the history of the country such as the building of tombs. They were used until as recently as the 1980s for seeking the help of buried saints. They can be seen next to some old mosques and are considered a part of the Maldives's cultural heritage. Other aspects of tassawuf, such as ritualised dhikr ceremonies called Maul\u016bdu (Mawlid) \u2013 the liturgy of which included recitations and certain supplications in a melodic tone \u2013 existed until very recent times. These Maul\u016bdu festivals were held in ornate tents specially built for the occasion. At present Islam is the official religion of the entire population, as adherence to it is required for citizenship. According to Arab traveller Ibn Battuta, the person responsible for this conversion was a Sunni Muslim visitor named Abu al-Barakat Yusuf al-Barbari, sailing from what is today Morocco. He is also referred to as Tabrizugefaanu. His venerated tomb now stands on the grounds of Medhu Ziyaaraiy, across the street from the Friday Mosque, or Hukuru Miskiy, in Mal\u00e9.

In 2013, scholar Felix Wilfred of Oxford University estimated the number of Christians in Maldives as 1,400 or 0.4% of the country's population.[188] Since the adoption of the 2008 constitution citizens and anyone wishing to become citizens is required by law to nominally follow Sunni Islam[189] which would make Maldives a 100% Muslim country in theory. But residents, tourists, and guest workers are free to be of any religion and practise them in private. However, in 2020, studies found that 0.29% of the population is Christian (roughly split between Catholic and Protestant).[190] Languages See also: Maldivian language Thaana script The official and national language is Dhivehi, an Indo-Aryan language closely related to the Sinhala language of Sri Lanka. The first known script used to write Dhivehi is the eveyla akuru script, which is found in the historical recording of kings (raadhavalhi). Later a script called Dhives akuru was used for a long period. The present-day script is called Thaana and is written from right to left. Thaana is derived from a mix of the old indigenous script of Dhives akuru and Arabic abjad. Thaana is said to have been introduced during the reign of Mohamed Thakurufaanu.

The nation is undergoing vast societal change, and English is part of this.\"[192] Otherwise, Arabic is taught in schools and mosques, as Sunni Islam is the state religion. The Maldivian population has formal or informal education in the reading, writing, and pronunciation of the Arabic language, as part of the compulsory religious education for all primary and secondary school students.[189] Thikijehi Thaana These additional letters were added to the Thaana alphabet by adding dots (nukuthaa) to existing letters, to allow for transliteration of Arabic loanwords, as previously Arabic loanwords were written using the Arabic script. Their usage is inconsistent, and becoming less frequent as the spelling changes to reflect pronunciation by Maldivians, rather than the original Arabic pronunciation, as the words get absorbed into the Maldivian language.

In the Maldives, there are three main ways to travel between islands: by domestic flight, by seaplane, or by boat.[199] For several years two seaplane companies were operating: TMA (Trans Maldivian Airways) and Maldivian Air Taxi, but these merged in 2013 under the name TMA. The seaplane fleet is entirely made up of DHC-6 Twin Otters.

The Maldives is southwest of Sri Lanka and India, about 750 kilometres (470 miles; 400 nautical miles) from the Asian continent's mainland. The Maldives' chain of 26 atolls stretches across the equator from Ihavandhippolhu Atoll in the north to Addu Atoll in the south. The Maldives is the smallest country in Asia. Its land area is only 298 square kilometres (115 sq mi), but this is spread over roughly 90,000 square kilometres (35,000 sq mi) of the sea, making it one of the world's most spatially dispersed sovereign states. With a population of 515,132 in the 2022 census, it is the second least populous country in Asia and the ninth-smallest country by area, but also one of the most densely populated countries. The Maldives has an average ground-level elevation of 1.5 metres (4 ft 11 in) above sea level,[10] and a highest natural point of only 2.4 metres (7 ft 10 in), making it the world's lowest-lying country. Some sources state the highest point, Mount Villingili, as 5.1 metres or 17 feet.[10] Mal\u00e9 is the capital and the most populated city, traditionally called the \"King's Island\", where the ancient royal dynasties ruled from its central location.[11] The Maldives has been inhabited for over 2,500 years.

Documented contact with the outside world began around 947 AD when Arab travelers began visiting the islands. In the 12th century, partly due to the importance of the Arabs and Persians as traders in the Indian Ocean, Islam reached the Maldivian Archipelago.[12] The Maldives was soon consolidated as a sultanate, developing strong commercial and cultural ties with Asia and Africa. From the mid-16th century, the region came under the increasing influence of European colonial powers, with the Maldives becoming a British protectorate in 1887. Independence from the United Kingdom came in 1965, and a presidential republic was established in 1968 with an elected People's Majlis. The ensuing decades have seen political instability, efforts at democratic reform,[13] and environmental challenges posed by climate change and rising sea levels.[14] The Maldives became a founding member of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC). The Maldives is a member of the United Nations, the Commonwealth of Nations, the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, and the Non-Aligned Movement. The World Bank classifies the Maldives as having an upper-middle income economy.[15] The Maldives is a Dialogue Partner of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation.[16] Fishing has historically been the dominant economic activity, and remains the largest sector by far, followed by the rapidly growing tourism industry.

The Maldives rates \"high\" on the Human Development Index,[17] with per capita income significantly higher than other SAARC nations.[18] The Maldives was a member of the Commonwealth of Nations from July 1982 until withdrawing from the organisation in October 2016 in protest of allegations of its human rights abuses and failing democracy.[19] The Maldives rejoined the Commonwealth on 1 February 2020 after showing evidence of functioning democratic processes and popular support.[20] Etymology See also: Names of the Maldives According to legends, the first settlers of the Maldives were people known as Dheyvis.[21] The first Kingdom of the Maldives was known as Kingdom of Dheeva Maari [bn].[22] During the 3rd century BCE visit of emissaries, it was noted that the Maldives was known as Dheeva Mahal.[21] During c. 1100 \u2013 1166, the Maldives was also referred to as Diva Kudha, and the Laccadive archipelago which was a part of the Maldives was then referred to as Diva Kanbar by the scholar and polymath al-Biruni.[23] The name Maldives may also derive from Sanskrit \u092e\u093e\u0932\u093e m\u0101l\u0101 (garland) and \u0926\u094d\u0935\u0940\u092a dv\u012bpa (island),[24] or \u0db8\u0dcf\u0dbd \u0daf\u0dd2\u0dc0\u0dba\u0dd2\u0db1 Maala Divaina (\"Necklace Islands\") in Sinhala.[25] The Maldivian people are called Dhivehin. The word Dheeb/Deeb (archaic Dhivehi, related to Sanskrit \u0926\u094d\u0935\u0940\u092a, dv\u012bpa) means \"island\", and Dhives (Dhivehin) means \"islanders\" (i.e., Maldivians).[26] In Tamil, \"Garland of Islands\" can be translated as M\u0101lait\u012bvu (\u0bae\u0bbe\u0bb2\u0bc8\u0ba4\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0bc0\u0bb5\u0bc1).[27] The venerable Sri Lankan chronicle",

Jan Hogendorn, professor of economics at Colby College, theorised that the name Maldives derives from the Sanskrit m\u0101l\u0101dv\u012bpa (\u092e\u093e\u0932\u093e\u0926\u094d\u0935\u0940\u092a), meaning \"garland of islands\".[24] In Malayalam, \"Garland of Islands\" can be translated as Maladweepu (\u0d2e\u0d3e\u0d32\u0d26\u0d4d\u0d35\u0d40\u0d2a\u0d4d).[28] In Kannada, \"Garland of Islands\" can be translated as Maaledweepa (\u0cae\u0cbe\u0cb2\u0cc6\u0ca6\u0ccd\u0cb5\u0cc0\u0caa).[29] None of these names are mentioned in any literature, however, classical Sanskrit texts dating back to the Vedic period mention the \"Hundred Thousand Islands\" (Lakshadweepa), a generic name which would include not only the Maldives, but also the Laccadives, Aminidivi Islands, Minicoy, and the Chagos island groups.[30][31] Medieval Muslim travellers such as Ibn Battuta called the islands Ma\u1e25al D\u012bb\u012by\u0101t (\u0645\u062d\u0644 \u062f\u064a\u0628\u064a\u0629) from the Arabic word ma\u1e25al (\"palace\"), which must be how the Berber traveller interpreted the name of Mal\u00e9, having been through Muslim North India, where Perso-Arabic words were introduced to the local vocabulary.[32] This is the name currently inscribed on the scroll in the Maldives state emblem.[1] The classical Persian/Arabic name for the Maldives is Dibajat.[33][34] The Dutch referred to the islands as the Maldivische Eilanden (pronounced [m\u0251l\u02c8divis\u0259 \u02c8\u0294\u025bil\u0251nd\u0259(n)]),[35] while the British anglicised the local name for the islands first to the \"Maldive Islands\" and",

In the Malabar language, nale means four, and diva means island. So that in that language, the word signifies 'four islands', while we, corrupting the name, call it Maldiva.\"[36] The local name for Maldives by the Maldivian people in Dhivehi language is \"Dhivehi Raajje\", (Dhivehi: \u078b\u07a8\u0788\u07ac\u0780\u07a8\u0783\u07a7\u0787\u07b0\u0796\u07ac).[37] History Main article: History of the Maldives Ancient history and settlement Main article: History of the Maldives \u00a7 Early Age In the 6th\u20135th century BCE, the Maldives already had their kingdoms.[21] The country has an established history of over 2,500 years according to historical evidence and legends.[38] The Mah\u0101va\u1e43sa (300 BCE) has records of people from Sri Lanka emigrating to the Maldives.[21] Assuming that cowrie shells come from the Maldives, historians believe that there may have been people living in the Maldives during the Indus Valley civilisation (3300\u20131300 BCE).[39] Several artefacts show the presence of Hinduism in the country before the Islamic period.[21] According to the book Kit\u0101b fi \u0101th\u0101r M\u012bdhu al-q\u0101dimah (\u0643\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u0641\u064a \u0622\u062b\u0627\u0631 \u0645\u064a\u0630\u0648 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u062f\u064a\u0645\u0629) (On the Ancient Ruins of Meedhoo), written in the 17th century in Arabic by Allama Ahmed Shihabuddine (Allama Shihab",

Shihabuddin's story tallies remarkably well with the recorded history of South Asia and that of the copperplate document of the Maldives known as Loamaafaanu.[21] The ancient history of the Maldives is told in copperplates, ancient scripts carved on coral artefacts, traditions, language, and different ethnicities of Maldivians.[21] The Maapanansa,[21] the copper plates on which were recorded the history of the first Kings of the Maldives from the Solar Dynasty, were lost quite early on. A 4th-century notice written by Ammianus Marcellinus (362 CE) speaks of gifts sent to the Roman emperor Julian by a deputation from the nation of Divi. The name Divi is very similar to Dheyvi who were the first settlers of Maldives.[21] The first Maldivians did not leave any archaeological artefacts. Their buildings were probably built of wood, palm fronds, and other perishable materials, which would have quickly decayed in the salt and wind of the tropical climate. Moreover, chiefs or headmen did not reside in elaborate stone palaces, nor did their religion require the construction of large temples or compounds.[40] Comparative",

Despite being just mentioned briefly in most history books, the 1,400 year-long Buddhist period has a foundational importance in the history of the Maldives. It was during this period that the culture of the Maldives both developed and flourished, a culture that survives today. The Maldivian language, early Maldive scripts, architecture, ruling institutions, customs, and manners of the Maldivians originated at the time when the Maldives were a Buddhist kingdom.[44] Buddhism probably spread to the Maldives in the 3rd century BCE at the time of Emperor Ashoka's expansion and became the dominant religion of the people of the Maldives until the 12th century. Archeological evidence from an ancient Buddhist monastery in Kaashidhoo has been dated between 205 and 560 AD, based on the radiocarbon dating of shell deposits unearthed from the foundations of stupas and other structures in the monastery.[45] The ancient Maldivian Kings promoted Buddhism, and the first Maldive writings and artistic achievements, in the form of highly developed sculpture and architecture, originate from that period. Nearly all archaeological remains in the Maldives are from Buddhist stupas and monasteries, and all artefacts found to date display characteristic Buddhist iconography.[citation needed] Islamic period See also: History of the Maldives \u00a7 Islamic Period, Islam in Maldives, List of Maldivian monarchs, and Sultanate of Maldives The",

Adopting the Muslim title of Sultan Muhammad al-Adil, he initiated a series of six Islamic dynasties that lasted until 1932 when the sultanate became elective. The formal title of the sultan up to 1965 was, Sultan of Land and Sea, Lord of the twelve-thousand islands and Sultan of the Maldives which came with the style Highness. A Moroccan traveller named Abu al-Barakat Yusuf al-Barbari is traditionally cited for this conversion.[46] According to the story told to Ibn Battutah, a mosque was built with the inscription: 'The Sultan Ahmad Shanurazah accepted Islam at the hand of Abu al-Barakat Yusuf al-Barbari.'[46][47] Some scholars have suggested the possibility of Ibn Battuta misreading Maldive texts, and having a bias towards the North African, Maghrebi narrative of this Shaykh, instead of the Persian origins account that was known as well at the time.[48] Others have it that he may have been from the Persian town of Tabriz.[49] This interpretation, held by the more reliable local historical chronicles, Raadavalhi and Taarikh,[50][51] is that Abu al-Barakat Yusuf al-Barbari was Abdul Barakat Yusuf Shams ud-D\u012bn at-Tabr\u012bz\u012b, also locally known",

The British expelled the Dutch from Ceylon in 1796 and included the Maldives as a British protectorate. The status of the Maldives as a British protectorate was officially recorded in an 1887 agreement in which the sultan Muhammad Mueenuddeen II accepted British influence over Maldivian external relations and defence while retaining home rule, which continued to be regulated by Muslim traditional institutions in exchange for an annual tribute.

Nasheed controversially resigned from office after a large number of police and army mutinied in February 2012. Nasheed's vice-president, Mohamed Waheed Hassan Manik, was sworn in as president.[79] Nasheed was later arrested,[80] convicted of terrorism, and sentenced to 13 years. The trial was widely seen as flawed and political. The UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention called for Nasheed's immediate release.[81] The election in late 2013 were highly contested. Former president Nasheed won the most votes in the first round, but the Supreme Court annulled it despite the positive assessment of international election observers. In the re-run vote Abdulla Yameen, the half-brother of the former president Maumoon, assumed the presidency.[77] Yameen survived an assassination attempt in late 2015.[82] Vice president Mohamed Jameel Ahmed was removed from office after a no confidence motion from the People's Majlis, it was alleged that he was conspiring with opposition political parties and planning riots.[83] Vice-president Ahmed Adeeb was later arrested together with 17 supporters for \"public order offences\" and the government instituted a broader crackdown against his accomplices. A state of emergency was later declared ahead of a planned anti-government rally,[84] and the People's Majlis (parliament) accelerated the removal of Adeeb.[85][86] In the 2018 election, Ibrahim Mohamed Solih won the most votes, and was sworn in as the Maldives' new president in November 2018.

Adeeb escaped in a tugboat to seek asylum in India. It is understood that the Indian Coast Guard escorted the tugboat to the International Maritime Boundary Line (IMBL) and he was then \"transferred\" to a Maldivian Coast Guard ship, where officials took him into custody.[87] Former president Abdulla Yameen was sentenced to five years in prison in November 2019 for money laundering.

Dark clouds bringing heavy rain, common in the rainy season The Maldives consists of 1,192 coral islands grouped in a double chain of 26 atolls, that stretch along a length of 871 kilometres (541 miles) north to south, 130 kilometres (81 miles) east to west, spread over roughly 90,000 square kilometres (35,000 sq mi), of which only 298 km2 (115 sq mi) is dry land, making this one of the world's most dispersed countries. It lies between latitudes 1\u00b0S and 8\u00b0N, and longitudes 72\u00b0 and 74\u00b0E. The atolls are composed of live coral reefs and sand bars, situated atop a submarine ridge 960 kilometres (600 mi) long that rises abruptly from the depths of the Indian Ocean and runs north to south. Only near the southern end of this natural coral barricade do two open passages permit safe ship navigation from one side of the Indian Ocean to the other through the territorial waters of the Maldives. For administrative purposes, the Maldivian government organised these atolls into 21 administrative divisions. The largest island of the Maldives is that of Gan, which belongs to Laamu Atoll or Hahdhummathi Maldives.

In areas where construction exists, however, this has been increased to several metres. More than 80 percent of the country's land is composed of coral islands which rise less than one metre above sea level.[94] As a result, the Maldives are in danger of being submerged due to rising sea levels. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has warned that, at current rates, sea-level rise would be high enough to make the Maldives uninhabitable by 2100.[95][96] Climate A beach of Bathala island The Maldives has a tropical monsoon climate (Am) under the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, which is affected by the large landmass of South Asia to the north. Because the Maldives has the lowest elevation of any country in the world, the temperature is constantly hot and often humid. The presence of this landmass causes differential heating of land and water. These factors set off a rush of moisture-rich air from the Indian Ocean over South Asia, resulting in the southwest monsoon.

The purchase of land will be made from a fund generated by tourism. The president explained his intentions: \"We do not want to leave the Maldives, but we also do not want to be climate refugees living in tents for decades\".[104] At the 2009 International Climate Talks, Nasheed stated that: For us swearing off fossil fuels is not only the right thing to do, but it is also in our economic self-interest... Pioneering countries will free themselves from the unpredictable price of foreign oil; they will capitalise on the new green economy of the future, and they will enhance their moral standing giving them greater political influence on the world stage.[105] Former president Mohamed Nasheed said in 2012 \"If carbon emissions continue at the rate they are climbing today, my country will be underwater in seven years.\"[106] He has called for more climate change mitigation action while on the American television shows The Daily Show[107] and the",

The research also reported that sea walls were compromising islands' ability to adjust to rising sea levels and that island drowning is an inevitable outcome for islands with coastal structures like sea walls.[111] Hideki Kanamaru, natural resources officer with the Food and Agriculture Organization in Asia-Pacific, said the study provided a \"new perspective\" on how island nations could tackle the challenge of sea-level rise, and that even if islands can adapt naturally to higher seas by raising their own crests, humans still needed to double down on global warming and protection for island populations.[109] Environment Environmental issues other than sea level rise include bad waste disposal and sand theft.

Sponges have gained importance as five species have displayed anti-tumor and anti-cancer properties.[117] In 1998, sea-temperature warming of as much as 5 \u00b0C (9.0 \u00b0F) due to a single El Ni\u00f1o phenomenon event caused coral bleaching, killing two-thirds of the nation's coral reefs.[118] To induce the regrowth of the reefs, scientists placed electrified cones anywhere from 20\u201360 feet (6.1\u201318.3 m) below the surface to provide a substrate for larval coral attachment. In 2004, scientists witnessed corals regenerating. Corals began to eject pink-orange eggs and sperm. The growth of these electrified corals was five times faster than untreated corals.[118] Scientist Azeez Hakim stated: Before 1998, we never thought that this reef would die. We had always taken for granted that these animals would be there, that this reef would be there forever. El Ni\u00f1o gave us a wake-up call that these things are not going to be there forever.

Furthermore, saltwater crocodiles have been reported to occasionally reach the islands, taking residence in marshy regions.[125] The location of this Indian Ocean archipelago means that its avifauna is mainly restricted to pelagic birds.[126] Most of the species are Eurasian migratory birds, only a few being typically associated with the Indian sub-continent. Some, like the frigatebird, are seasonal. Some birds dwell in marshes and island bush, like the grey heron and the moorhen.

The islands are administered by an elected Island Council. In addition to a name, every administrative division is identified by the Maldivian code letters, such as \"Haa Alif\" for Thiladhunmati Uthuruburi (Thiladhunmathi North); and by a Latin code letter. The first corresponds to the geographical Maldivian name of the atoll; the second is a code adopted for convenience. As certain islands in different atolls have the same name, for administrative purposes this code is quoted before the name of the island, for example: Baa Funadhoo, Kaafu Funadhoo, Gaafu-Alifu Funadhoo. Since most atolls have very long geographical names it is also used whenever the long name is inconvenient, for example in the atoll website names.[162] The introduction of code-letter names has been a source of much puzzlement and misunderstanding, especially among foreigners. Many people have come to think that the code letter of the administrative atoll is its new name and that it has replaced its geographical name.

From the 2nd century CE, the islands were known as the 'Money Isles' by the Arabs.[163] Monetaria moneta was used for centuries as a currency in Africa, and huge amounts of Maldivian cowries were introduced into Africa by western nations during the period of slave trade.[164] The cowry is now the symbol of the Maldives Monetary Authority. In the early 1970s and 1980s, the Maldives was one of the world's 20 poorest countries, with a population of 100,000.[165] The economy at the time was largely dependent on fisheries and trading local goods such as coir rope, ambergris (Maavaharu), and coco de mer (Tavakkaashi) with neighbouring countries and East Asian countries.[166] The Maldivian government began a largely successful economic reform programme in the 1980s, initiated by lifting import quotas and giving more opportunities to the private sector. At that time, the tourism sector was in its infant stage but would later play a significant role in the nation's development. Agriculture and manufacturing continue to play lesser roles in the economy, constrained by the limited availability of cultivable land and the shortage of domestic labour.

Tourism accounts for 28% of the GDP and more than 60% of the Maldives' foreign exchange receipts. Over 90% of government tax revenue comes from import duties and tourism-related taxes. The development of tourism fostered the overall growth of the country's economy. It created direct and indirect employment and income generation opportunities in other related industries. The first tourist resorts were opened in 1972 with Bandos Island Resort and Kurumba Village (the current name is Kurumba Maldives),[169] which transformed the Maldives' economy. The resort island of Landaa Giraavaru (Baa atoll) According to the Ministry of Tourism, the emergence of tourism in 1972 transformed the economy, moving rapidly from dependence on fisheries to tourism. In just three and a half decades, the industry became the main source of income. Tourism was also the country's biggest foreign currency earner and the single largest contributor to the GDP.

Fishing remains the main occupation of the people and the government gives priority to the fisheries sector. The mechanisation of the traditional fishing boat called dhoni in 1974 was a major milestone in the development of the fisheries industry. A fish canning plant was installed on Felivaru in 1977, as a joint venture with a Japanese firm. In 1979, a Fisheries Advisory Board was set up with the mandate of advising the government on policy guidelines for the overall development of the fisheries sector. Manpower development programmes began in the early 1980s, and fisheries education was incorporated into the school curriculum. Fish aggregating devices and navigational aids were located at various strategic points. Moreover, the opening up of the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of the Maldives for fisheries has further enhanced the growth of the fisheries sector.

In the past, there was also a small Tamil population known as the Giraavaru people. This group has now been almost completely absorbed into the larger Maldivian society but was once native to the island of Giraavaru, which was evacuated in 1968 due to heavy erosion of the island.[180] Some social stratification exists on the islands.

They were used until as recently as the 1980s for seeking the help of buried saints. They can be seen next to some old mosques and are considered a part of the Maldives's cultural heritage. Other aspects of tassawuf, such as ritualised dhikr ceremonies called Maul\u016bdu (Mawlid) \u2013 the liturgy of which included recitations and certain supplications in a melodic tone \u2013 existed until very recent times. These Maul\u016bdu festivals were held in ornate tents specially built for the occasion. At present Islam is the official religion of the entire population, as adherence to it is required for citizenship. According to Arab traveller Ibn Battuta, the person responsible for this conversion was a Sunni Muslim visitor named Abu al-Barakat Yusuf al-Barbari, sailing from what is today Morocco. He is also referred to as Tabrizugefaanu. His venerated tomb now stands on the grounds of Medhu Ziyaaraiy, across the street from the Friday Mosque, or Hukuru Miskiy, in Mal\u00e9.

Transportation Main articles: Transport in the Maldives and List of airports in the Maldives Velana International Airport TMA Terminal Velana International Airport is the principal gateway to the Maldives; it is adjacent to the capital city Mal\u00e9 and is connected by a bridge. International travel is available on government-owned Island Aviation Services (branded as Maldivian), which operates DHC-6 Twin Otter seaplanes and to nearly all Maldivian domestic airports with several Bombardier Dash 8 aircraft, and one Airbus A320 with international service to India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, and Thailand. In the Maldives, there are three main ways to travel between islands: by domestic flight, by seaplane, or by boat.[199] For several years two seaplane companies were operating: TMA (Trans Maldivian Airways) and Maldivian Air Taxi, but these merged in 2013 under the name TMA. The seaplane fleet is entirely made up of DHC-6 Twin Otters. There is also another airline, Villa Air, which operates using ATR planes to domestic airports, principally Villa-Maamigili, Dharavandhoo and some others. Manta Air began its first scheduled seaplane service in 2019. Its seaplane fleet is made up of DHC-6 Twin Otter aircraft. In addition to the seaplane service, Manta Air utilises ATR 72\u2013600 aircraft to operate domestic flights to Dhaalu Airport, Dharavandhoo Airport and Kooddoo Airport from the main Velana International Airport.[200] Depending on the distance of the destination",

Several daily flights operate from Velana International Airport to the 18 domestic and international airports in the country. Scheduled ferries also operate from Mal\u00e9 to many of the atolls. The traditional Maldivian boat is called a dhoni, one of the oldest known sea vessels in the Maldives.[201] Speedboats and seaplanes tend to be more expensive, while travel by dhoni, although slower, is relatively cheaper and convenient. Education Main article: Education in the Maldives The Maldives National University is one of the country's institutions of higher education.[f][202] In 1973, the Allied Health Services Training Centre (the forerunner of the Faculty of Health Sciences) was established by the Ministry of Health.[203] The Vocational Training Centre was established in 1974, providing training for mechanical and electrical trades.[204] In 1984, the Institute for Teacher Education was created and the School of Hotel and Catering Services was established in 1987 to provide trained personnel for the tourist industry.[205] In 1991, the Institute of Management and Administration was created to train staff for public and private services.

The Institute of Shar'ah and Law was founded in January 1999. In 2000 the college launched its first-degree programme, Bachelor of Arts. On 17 January 2011, the Maldives National University Act was passed by the President of the Maldives; The Maldives National University was named on 15 February 2011. In 2015 under a Presidential decree the College of Islamic Studies was changed into the Islamic University of Maldives (IUM).[206] The Maldivian government now offers 3 different scholarships to students who have completed their higher secondary education with results above a certain threshold, with ranks of the scholarship received depending on the merits achieved by students on their year 12 examinations.[207] Culture Main article: Culture of the Maldives See also: Maldivian cuisine and Folklore of the Maldives Maahefun Festival in Fuvahmulah The culture of the Maldives is influenced by the cultures of the people of different ethnicities who have settled on the islands throughout the times. Since the 12th century AD, there were also influences from Arabia in the language and culture of the Maldives because of the conversion to Islam and its location as a crossroads in the central Indian Ocean.[208] This was due to the long trading history between the far east and the middle east. Reflective of this is the fact that the Maldives has had the highest national divorce rate in the world for many decades. This, it",

Reflective of this is the fact that the Maldives has had the highest national divorce rate in the world for many decades. This, it is hypothesised, is due to a combination of liberal Islamic rules about divorce and the relatively loose marital bonds that have been identified as common in non- and semi-sedentary peoples without a history of fully developed agrarian property and kinship relations.[209] Media Main articles: Television Maldives, Voice of Maldives, and List of newspapers in the Maldives PSM News serves as the country's main media, owned by the government of the Maldives.[210] The newspaper was founded on 3 May 2017, in the celebration of World Press Freedom Day.[211] Maldives has been ranked one\u2013hundred in the World Press Freedom Index 2023 and 106 in 2024.[212] The country's first daily newspaper, Haveeru Daily News was the first and longest\u2013serving newspaper in the history of the Maldives, which was registered on 28 December 1978, and dissolved in 2016.[213] Article 28 of the Maldives Constitution guarantees freedom of the press and stipulates that: No person shall be compelled to disclose the source of any information that is espoused, disseminated, or published by that person.[214] However, this protection is compromised by the Evidence Act, which came into effect in January 2023 and grants courts the authority to compel journalists to reveal their confidential sources.

Given its unique geography of scattered islands surrounded by the Indian Ocean, water sports naturally hold a prominent position. Surfing, in particular, has gained international recognition, with waves that cater to both beginners and seasoned surfers. Locations such as the atolls of North and South Mal\u00e9, Thulusdhoo, and Himmafushi offer ideal conditions for enthusiasts to ride the waves throughout the years.[216] Additionally, diving and snorkeling are immensely popular, allowing locals and tourists alike to explore the rich marine life that thrives in the crystal-clear waters surrounding the Maldives.[217] Maldives against Bangladesh at the 2021 SAFF Championship.

Flyboarding in Maldives Traditional Maldivian sports also play a significant role in preserving cultural heritage and promoting physical activity. Bodu Beru, a rhythmic drumming and dance performance, often accompanies traditional sports events, adding to the festive ambiance. One such traditional sport is \"Baibalaa\", a game resembling volleyball but played with a woven ball made from dried coconut palm leaves. \"Fenei Bashi\", a form of wrestling, is another traditional sport that showcases strength and agility. These indigenous sports serve as a reminder of the Maldives' rich cultural heritage and continue to be cherished by communities across the islands.

The Maldives is southwest of Sri Lanka and India, about 750 kilometres (470 miles; 400 nautical miles) from the Asian continent's mainland. The Maldives' chain of 26 atolls stretches across the equator from Ihavandhippolhu Atoll in the north to Addu Atoll in the south. The Maldives is the smallest country in Asia. Its land area is only 298 square kilometres (115 sq mi), but this is spread over roughly 90,000 square kilometres (35,000 sq mi) of the sea, making it one of the world's most spatially dispersed sovereign states. With a population of 515,132 in the 2022 census, it is the second least populous country in Asia and the ninth-smallest country by area, but also one of the most densely populated countries. The Maldives has an average ground-level elevation of 1.5 metres (4 ft 11 in) above sea level,[10] and a highest natural point of only 2.4 metres (7 ft 10 in), making it the world's lowest-lying country. Some sources state the highest point, Mount Villingili, as 5.1 metres or 17 feet.[10] Mal\u00e9 is the capital and the most populated city, traditionally called the \"King's Island\", where the ancient royal dynasties ruled from its central location.[11] The Maldives has been inhabited for over 2,500 years.

Documented contact with the outside world began around 947 AD when Arab travelers began visiting the islands. In the 12th century, partly due to the importance of the Arabs and Persians as traders in the Indian Ocean, Islam reached the Maldivian Archipelago.[12] The Maldives was soon consolidated as a sultanate, developing strong commercial and cultural ties with Asia and Africa. From the mid-16th century, the region came under the increasing influence of European colonial powers, with the Maldives becoming a British protectorate in 1887. Independence from the United Kingdom came in 1965, and a presidential republic was established in 1968 with an elected People's Majlis. The ensuing decades have seen political instability, efforts at democratic reform,[13] and environmental challenges posed by climate change and rising sea levels.[14] The Maldives became a founding member of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC). The Maldives is a member of the United Nations, the Commonwealth of Nations, the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, and the Non-Aligned Movement. The World Bank classifies the Maldives as having an upper-middle income economy.[15] The Maldives is a Dialogue Partner of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation.[16] Fishing has historically been the dominant economic activity, and remains the largest sector by far, followed by the rapidly growing tourism industry.

Jan Hogendorn, professor of economics at Colby College, theorised that the name Maldives derives from the Sanskrit m\u0101l\u0101dv\u012bpa (\u092e\u093e\u0932\u093e\u0926\u094d\u0935\u0940\u092a), meaning \"garland of islands\".[24] In Malayalam, \"Garland of Islands\" can be translated as Maladweepu (\u0d2e\u0d3e\u0d32\u0d26\u0d4d\u0d35\u0d40\u0d2a\u0d4d).[28] In Kannada, \"Garland of Islands\" can be translated as Maaledweepa (\u0cae\u0cbe\u0cb2\u0cc6\u0ca6\u0ccd\u0cb5\u0cc0\u0caa).[29] None of these names are mentioned in any literature, however, classical Sanskrit texts dating back to the Vedic period mention the \"Hundred Thousand Islands\" (Lakshadweepa), a generic name which would include not only the Maldives, but also the Laccadives, Aminidivi Islands, Minicoy, and the Chagos island groups.[30][31] Medieval Muslim travellers such as Ibn Battuta called the islands Ma\u1e25al D\u012bb\u012by\u0101t (\u0645\u062d\u0644 \u062f\u064a\u0628\u064a\u0629) from the Arabic word ma\u1e25al (\"palace\"), which must be how the Berber traveller interpreted the name of Mal\u00e9, having been through Muslim North India, where Perso-Arabic words were introduced to the local vocabulary.[32] This is the name currently inscribed on the scroll in the Maldives state emblem.[1] The classical Persian/Arabic name for the Maldives is Dibajat.[33][34] The Dutch referred to the islands as the Maldivische Eilanden (pronounced [m\u0251l\u02c8divis\u0259 \u02c8\u0294\u025bil\u0251nd\u0259(n)]),[35] while the British anglicised the local name for the islands first to the \"Maldive Islands\" and",

In the Malabar language, nale means four, and diva means island. So that in that language, the word signifies 'four islands', while we, corrupting the name, call it Maldiva.\"[36] The local name for Maldives by the Maldivian people in Dhivehi language is \"Dhivehi Raajje\", (Dhivehi: \u078b\u07a8\u0788\u07ac\u0780\u07a8\u0783\u07a7\u0787\u07b0\u0796\u07ac).[37] History Main article: History of the Maldives Ancient history and settlement Main article: History of the Maldives \u00a7 Early Age In the 6th\u20135th century BCE, the Maldives already had their kingdoms.[21] The country has an established history of over 2,500 years according to historical evidence and legends.[38] The Mah\u0101va\u1e43sa (300 BCE) has records of people from Sri Lanka emigrating to the Maldives.[21] Assuming that cowrie shells come from the Maldives, historians believe that there may have been people living in the Maldives during the Indus Valley civilisation (3300\u20131300 BCE).[39] Several artefacts show the presence of Hinduism in the country before the Islamic period.[21] According to the book Kit\u0101b fi \u0101th\u0101r M\u012bdhu al-q\u0101dimah (\u0643\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u0641\u064a \u0622\u062b\u0627\u0631 \u0645\u064a\u0630\u0648 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u062f\u064a\u0645\u0629) (On the Ancient Ruins of Meedhoo), written in the 17th century in Arabic by Allama Ahmed Shihabuddine (Allama Shihab",

Shihabuddin's story tallies remarkably well with the recorded history of South Asia and that of the copperplate document of the Maldives known as Loamaafaanu.[21] The ancient history of the Maldives is told in copperplates, ancient scripts carved on coral artefacts, traditions, language, and different ethnicities of Maldivians.[21] The Maapanansa,[21] the copper plates on which were recorded the history of the first Kings of the Maldives from the Solar Dynasty, were lost quite early on. A 4th-century notice written by Ammianus Marcellinus (362 CE) speaks of gifts sent to the Roman emperor Julian by a deputation from the nation of Divi. The name Divi is very similar to Dheyvi who were the first settlers of Maldives.[21] The first Maldivians did not leave any archaeological artefacts. Their buildings were probably built of wood, palm fronds, and other perishable materials, which would have quickly decayed in the salt and wind of the tropical climate. Moreover, chiefs or headmen did not reside in elaborate stone palaces, nor did their religion require the construction of large temples or compounds.[40] Comparative",

The book was written in 1194 CE (590 AH) in the Ev\u0113la form of the Divehi akuru, during the reign of Siri Fennaadheettha Mahaa Radun (Dhinei Kalaminja). Despite being just mentioned briefly in most history books, the 1,400 year-long Buddhist period has a foundational importance in the history of the Maldives. It was during this period that the culture of the Maldives both developed and flourished, a culture that survives today. The Maldivian language, early Maldive scripts, architecture, ruling institutions, customs, and manners of the Maldivians originated at the time when the Maldives were a Buddhist kingdom.[44] Buddhism probably spread to the Maldives in the 3rd century BCE at the time of Emperor Ashoka's expansion and became the dominant religion of the people of the Maldives until the 12th century. Archeological evidence from an ancient Buddhist monastery in Kaashidhoo has been dated between 205 and 560 AD, based on the radiocarbon dating of shell deposits unearthed from the foundations of stupas and other structures in the monastery.[45] The ancient Maldivian Kings promoted Buddhism, and the first Maldive writings and artistic achievements, in the form of highly developed sculpture and architecture, originate from that period. Nearly all archaeological remains in the Maldives are from Buddhist stupas and monasteries, and all artefacts found to date display characteristic Buddhist iconography.[citation needed] Islamic period See also: History of the Maldives \u00a7 Islamic Period, Islam in Maldives, List of Maldivian monarchs, and Sultanate of Maldives The",

Adopting the Muslim title of Sultan Muhammad al-Adil, he initiated a series of six Islamic dynasties that lasted until 1932 when the sultanate became elective. The formal title of the sultan up to 1965 was, Sultan of Land and Sea, Lord of the twelve-thousand islands and Sultan of the Maldives which came with the style Highness. A Moroccan traveller named Abu al-Barakat Yusuf al-Barbari is traditionally cited for this conversion.[46] According to the story told to Ibn Battutah, a mosque was built with the inscription: 'The Sultan Ahmad Shanurazah accepted Islam at the hand of Abu al-Barakat Yusuf al-Barbari.'[46][47] Some scholars have suggested the possibility of Ibn Battuta misreading Maldive texts, and having a bias towards the North African, Maghrebi narrative of this Shaykh, instead of the Persian origins account that was known as well at the time.[48] Others have it that he may have been from the Persian town of Tabriz.[49] This interpretation, held by the more reliable local historical chronicles, Raadavalhi and Taarikh,[50][51] is that Abu al-Barakat Yusuf al-Barbari was Abdul Barakat Yusuf Shams ud-D\u012bn at-Tabr\u012bz\u012b, also locally known",

The British expelled the Dutch from Ceylon in 1796 and included the Maldives as a British protectorate. The status of the Maldives as a British protectorate was officially recorded in an 1887 agreement in which the sultan Muhammad Mueenuddeen II accepted British influence over Maldivian external relations and defence while retaining home rule, which continued to be regulated by Muslim traditional institutions in exchange for an annual tribute.

On 15 March 1968, a national referendum was held on the question, and 93.34% of those taking part voted in favour of establishing a republic.[63] The republic was declared on 11 November 1968, thus ending the 853-year-old monarchy, which was replaced by a republic under the presidency of Ibrahim Nasir.[64] As the King had held little real power, this was seen as a cosmetic change and required few alterations in the structures of government.

It lies between latitudes 1\u00b0S and 8\u00b0N, and longitudes 72\u00b0 and 74\u00b0E.

Only near the southern end of this natural coral barricade do two open passages permit safe ship navigation from one side of the Indian Ocean to the other through the territorial waters of the Maldives.

The purchase of land will be made from a fund generated by tourism. The president explained his intentions: \"We do not want to leave the Maldives, but we also do not want to be climate refugees living in tents for decades\".[104] At the 2009 International Climate Talks, Nasheed stated that: For us swearing off fossil fuels is not only the right thing to do, but it is also in our economic self-interest... Pioneering countries will free themselves from the unpredictable price of foreign oil; they will capitalise on the new green economy of the future, and they will enhance their moral standing giving them greater political influence on the world stage.[105] Former president Mohamed Nasheed said in 2012 \"If carbon emissions continue at the rate they are climbing today, my country will be underwater in seven years.\"[106] He has called for more climate change mitigation action while on the American television shows The Daily Show[107] and the",

The research also reported that sea walls were compromising islands' ability to adjust to rising sea levels and that island drowning is an inevitable outcome for islands with coastal structures like sea walls.[111] Hideki Kanamaru, natural resources officer with the Food and Agriculture Organization in Asia-Pacific, said the study provided a \"new perspective\" on how island nations could tackle the challenge of sea-level rise, and that even if islands can adapt naturally to higher seas by raising their own crests, humans still needed to double down on global warming and protection for island populations.[109] Environment Environmental issues other than sea level rise include bad waste disposal and sand theft.

There are 187 species of coral forming the coral reefs. This area of the Indian Ocean, alone, houses 1,100 species of fish, 5 species of sea turtle, 21 species of whale and dolphin, 400 species of mollusk, and 83 species of echinoderms. The area is also populated by several crustacean species: 120 copepods, and 15 amphipods, as well as more than 145 crab and 48 shrimp species.[114] Among the many marine families represented are pufferfish, fusiliers, jackfish, lionfish, oriental sweetlips, reef sharks, groupers, eels, snappers, bannerfish, batfish, humphead wrasse, spotted eagle rays, scorpionfish, lobsters, nudibranches, angelfish, butterflyfish, squirrelfish, soldierfish, glassfish, surgeonfish,",

Sponges have gained importance as five species have displayed anti-tumor and anti-cancer properties.[117] In 1998, sea-temperature warming of as much as 5 \u00b0C (9.0 \u00b0F) due to a single El Ni\u00f1o phenomenon event caused coral bleaching, killing two-thirds of the nation's coral reefs.[118] To induce the regrowth of the reefs, scientists placed electrified cones anywhere from 20\u201360 feet (6.1\u201318.3 m) below the surface to provide a substrate for larval coral attachment. In 2004, scientists witnessed corals regenerating. Corals began to eject pink-orange eggs and sperm. The growth of these electrified corals was five times faster than untreated corals.[118] Scientist Azeez Hakim stated: Before 1998, we never thought that this reef would die. We had always taken for granted that these animals would be there, that this reef would be there forever. El Ni\u00f1o gave us a wake-up call that these things are not going to be there forever.

Over recent decades of intensive development, numerous natural environments crucial to indigenous species have suffered severe endangerment or outright destruction. Coral reef habitats have been damaged, as the pressure for land has brought about the creation of artificial islands. Some reefs have been filled with rubble with little regard for the changes in the currents on the reef shelf and how the new pattern would affect coral growth and its related life forms on the reef edges.[122] Mangroves thrive in brackish or muddy regions of the Maldives. The archipelago hosts fourteen species spanning ten genera, among which is the fern Acrostichum aureum, indigenous to these islands.[123] The waters surrounding the Maldives boast an extensive array of marine life, showcasing a vibrant tapestry of corals and over 2,000 species of fish.[124] From the dazzling hues of reef fish to the majestic presence of the blacktip reef shark, moray eels, and a diverse range of rays including manta rays, stingrays, and eagle rays, the seas teem with life.

Among the limited terrestrial reptilian inhabitants are a species of gecko and the oriental garden lizard (Calotes versicolor), alongside the white-spotted supple skink (Riopa albopunctata), the Indian wolf snake (Lycodon aulicus), and the brahmin blind snake (Ramphotyphlops braminus). In the surrounding seas, however, a more diverse array of reptilian life thrives. Maldivian beaches serve as nesting grounds for the green sea turtle (Chelonia mydas), the hawksbill sea turtle, and the leatherback sea turtle. Furthermore, saltwater crocodiles have been reported to occasionally reach the islands, taking residence in marshy regions.[125] The location of this Indian Ocean archipelago means that its avifauna is mainly restricted to pelagic birds.[126] Most of the species are Eurasian migratory birds, only a few being typically associated with the Indian sub-continent. Some, like the frigatebird, are seasonal. Some birds dwell in marshes and island bush, like the grey heron and the moorhen.

The first corresponds to the geographical Maldivian name of the atoll; the second is a code adopted for convenience. As certain islands in different atolls have the same name, for administrative purposes this code is quoted before the name of the island, for example: Baa Funadhoo, Kaafu Funadhoo, Gaafu-Alifu Funadhoo. Since most atolls have very long geographical names it is also used whenever the long name is inconvenient, for example in the atoll website names.[162] The introduction of code-letter names has been a source of much puzzlement and misunderstanding, especially among foreigners. Many people have come to think that the code letter of the administrative atoll is its new name and that it has replaced its geographical name. Under such circumstances, it is hard to know which is the correct name to use.[162] Economy Main article: Economy of the Maldives Mal\u00e9 harbour Historically, the Maldives provided enormous quantities of cowry shells, an international currency of the early ages.

From the 2nd century CE, the islands were known as the 'Money Isles' by the Arabs.[163] Monetaria moneta was used for centuries as a currency in Africa, and huge amounts of Maldivian cowries were introduced into Africa by western nations during the period of slave trade.[164] The cowry is now the symbol of the Maldives Monetary Authority. In the early 1970s and 1980s, the Maldives was one of the world's 20 poorest countries, with a population of 100,000.[165] The economy at the time was largely dependent on fisheries and trading local goods such as coir rope, ambergris (Maavaharu), and coco de mer (Tavakkaashi) with neighbouring countries and East Asian countries.[166] The Maldivian government began a largely successful economic reform programme in the 1980s, initiated by lifting import quotas and giving more opportunities to the private sector. At that time, the tourism sector was in its infant stage but would later play a significant role in the nation's development. Agriculture and manufacturing continue to play lesser roles in the economy, constrained by the limited availability of cultivable land and the shortage of domestic labour.

Only 200 islands are home to its 382,751 inhabitants.[167][168] The other islands are used entirely for economic purposes, of which tourism and agriculture are the most dominant. Tourism accounts for 28% of the GDP and more than 60% of the Maldives' foreign exchange receipts. Over 90% of government tax revenue comes from import duties and tourism-related taxes. The development of tourism fostered the overall growth of the country's economy. It created direct and indirect employment and income generation opportunities in other related industries. The first tourist resorts were opened in 1972 with Bandos Island Resort and Kurumba Village (the current name is Kurumba Maldives),[169] which transformed the Maldives' economy. The resort island of Landaa Giraavaru (Baa atoll) According to the Ministry of Tourism, the emergence of tourism in 1972 transformed the economy, moving rapidly from dependence on fisheries to tourism. In just three and a half decades, the industry became the main source of income. Tourism was also the country's biggest foreign currency earner and the single largest contributor to the GDP. As of 2008, 89 resorts in the Maldives offered over 17,000 beds and hosted over 600,000 tourists annually.[170] In 2019, over 1.7 million visitors came to the islands.[171] The number of resorts increased from 2 to 92 between 1972 and 2007.

Fishing remains the main occupation of the people and the government gives priority to the fisheries sector. The mechanisation of the traditional fishing boat called dhoni in 1974 was a major milestone in the development of the fisheries industry. A fish canning plant was installed on Felivaru in 1977, as a joint venture with a Japanese firm. In 1979, a Fisheries Advisory Board was set up with the mandate of advising the government on policy guidelines for the overall development of the fisheries sector. Manpower development programmes began in the early 1980s, and fisheries education was incorporated into the school curriculum. Fish aggregating devices and navigational aids were located at various strategic points. Moreover, the opening up of the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of the Maldives for fisheries has further enhanced the growth of the fisheries sector. As of 2010, fisheries contributed over 15% of the country's GDP and engaged about 30% of the country's workforce. Fisheries were also the second-largest foreign exchange earner after tourism.

This group has now been almost completely absorbed into the larger Maldivian society but was once native to the island of Giraavaru, which was evacuated in 1968 due to heavy erosion of the island.[180] Some social stratification exists on the islands.

They were used until as recently as the 1980s for seeking the help of buried saints. They can be seen next to some old mosques and are considered a part of the Maldives's cultural heritage. Other aspects of tassawuf, such as ritualised dhikr ceremonies called Maul\u016bdu (Mawlid) \u2013 the liturgy of which included recitations and certain supplications in a melodic tone \u2013 existed until very recent times. These Maul\u016bdu festivals were held in ornate tents specially built for the occasion. At present Islam is the official religion of the entire population, as adherence to it is required for citizenship. According to Arab traveller Ibn Battuta, the person responsible for this conversion was a Sunni Muslim visitor named Abu al-Barakat Yusuf al-Barbari, sailing from what is today Morocco. He is also referred to as Tabrizugefaanu. His venerated tomb now stands on the grounds of Medhu Ziyaaraiy, across the street from the Friday Mosque, or Hukuru Miskiy, in Mal\u00e9.

' TOI Sports Desk / TIMESOFINDIA.COM / Apr 26, 2025, 09:01 IST Share AA + TEXT SIZE Small Medium Large Mahendra Singh Dhoni expressed disappointment as Chennai Super Kings suffered a five-wicket defeat against Sunrisers Hyderabad, further diminishing their IPL 2025 play-off hopes. Dhoni felt that their score of 154 was inadequate on the Chepauk pitch, and the team's overall performance lacked cohesion. \u200b\u200bCSK, meanwhile, sit at the bottom with just two wins from nine games and only four points to show. Image credit: BCCI/IPL NEW DELHI: The expression on captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni\u2019s face said it all as Chennai Super Kings suffered another defeat\u2014this time a five-wicket loss to Sunrisers Hyderabad at the MA Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai on Friday. A visibly disappointed Dhoni admitted that a total of 154 was far from \u201cjustifiable\u201d on a Chepauk pitch that didn\u2019t have any demons, as SRH dealt a near-fatal blow to CSK\u2019s IPL 2025 play-off chances. Sunrisers chased down the modest target in just 18.4 overs. Dhoni pointed out that it's always tough when several players fail to deliver simultaneously.

For the skipper, the lack of cohesion in the team's overall effort was most frustrating. \"I think we kept losing wickets and another thing is in the first innings the wicket was slightly better and 157 wasn't a justifiable score,\" Dhoni said after CSK\u2019s loss. \"It wasn't turning a lot, a little two-paced but nothing out of the ordinary. Yes, second innings there was a bit of help. Our spinners, the quality was there and they were bowling in the right areas, but we were 15-20 runs short,\" he added. Commenting on Dewald Brevis\u2019 performance, Dhoni said, \"[On Brevis] I think he batted really well and we needed that in the middle order. When the spinners come in, you do it either by batsmanship or picking the right areas, but that's an area where we want to improve because middle overs are crucial.\" Reflecting on the broader issues plaguing the team, Dhoni didn\u2019t hold back. Sachin Tendulkar at 52: Power, Pride, and a Nation\u2019s Pulse \"In a tournament like this, if there are one or two areas to plug in the holes it's good, but when a majority of the players are not doing well you need to make changes. You can't just keep going. We are just not putting enough runs on the board,\" he said. With this win, SRH have moved up to eighth place on the points table, registering three wins and six losses for a total of six points. CSK, meanwhile, sit at the bottom with just two",

Kohli found his way into the U-15 team.[1] He received training at the academy and participated in matches at the Sumeet Dogra Academy located at Vasundhara Enclave.[18] In pursuit of furthering his cricketing career, he transferred to Saviour Convent School during his ninth-grade education.[17] On 18 December 2006, his father died due to a cerebral attack.[17][15] As per his mother, Kohli's demeanour shifted noticeably after his father's death.

He is appreciated for his ability to execute wrist shots and his consistent prowess in the mid-wicket and cover region.[305][306] Kohli playing his famous flick shot at the 2015 Cricket World Cup Kohli has often expressed his admiration for the cover drive, which he considers to be his signature stroke.

In May, his father arranged for him to meet Rajkumar Sharma.[1] Upon the suggestion of their neighbours, Kohli's father considered enrolling his son in a professional cricket academy, as they believed his ability merited more than gully cricket.[17] He was unable to secure a place in the U-14 Delhi team, due to extraneous factors. His father reportedly received offers to relocate his son to influential clubs, which would ensure his selection, but he declined the proposals. Kohli found his way into the U-15 team.[1] He received training at the academy and participated in matches at the Sumeet Dogra Academy located at Vasundhara Enclave.[18] In pursuit of furthering his cricketing career, he transferred to Saviour Convent School during his ninth-grade education.[17] On 18 December 2006, his father died due to a cerebral attack.[17][15] As per his mother, Kohli's demeanour shifted noticeably after his father's death. He took on cricket with newfound seriousness, prioritizing playing time and dedicating himself fully to the sport.[17] Kohli's family resided in Meera Bagh, Paschim Vihar until the year 2015, after which they relocated to Gurgaon.[19] Youth career Representing India U19 World Cup 2008 Malaysia Captain Player of the Match Vs West Indies Vs New Zealand Delhi team Kohli's junior cricket career kicked off in October 2002 at the Luhnu Cricket Ground against Himachal Pradesh.
