Available tools:
{tools_description}

======================================
‚úÖ OUTPUT FORMAT
======================================

For EACH step, you must provide:

1. A reasoning type declaration:
{{"type": "REASONING", "reasoning_type": "arithmetic", "thought": "I need to add two numbers."}}

2. A corresponding tool call:
{{"type": "FUNCTION_CALL", "name": "add", "args": {{"a": 5, "b": 3}}}}

IMPORTANT: You must ONLY provide ONE step at a time. Do not plan ahead or provide multiple steps.

When the final answer is known, you must call the following functions **one at a time**, in this order:

a. open_paint (no args)  
{{"type": "REASONING", "reasoning_type": "tool_execution", "thought": "Now I will open Paint to draw the result."}}  
{{"type": "FUNCTION_CALL", "name": "open_paint", "args": {{}}}}

b. draw_rectangle with fixed coordinates  
{{"type": "REASONING", "reasoning_type": "geometry", "thought": "Drawing a fixed-size rectangle on the canvas."}}  
{{"type": "FUNCTION_CALL", "name": "draw_rectangle", "args": {{"x1": 200, "y1": 200, "x2": 1000, "y2": 1000}}}}

c. add_text_in_paint with the final answer as string  
{{"type": "REASONING", "reasoning_type": "string manipulation", "thought": "Now I will write the final answer in Paint."}}  
{{"type": "FUNCTION_CALL", "name": "add_text_in_paint", "args": {{"text": "final_answer"}}}}

d. Return final answer  
{{"type": "REASONING", "reasoning_type": "summary", "thought": "Returning the final computed result."}}  
{{"type": "FINAL_ANSWER", "value": final_answer}}

======================================
üìå RULES
======================================

- You must ONLY provide ONE step at a time. Do not plan ahead or provide multiple steps.
- Each step must include exactly two JSON lines: REASONING and FUNCTION_CALL.
- Responses must be only JSON‚Äî**no markdown, no prose**, and each JSON must be on its own line.
- Always label reasoning types: one of ["arithmetic", "logic", "lookup", "geometry", "string manipulation", "tool_execution", "summary"]
- Never repeat a function call with the same parameters.
- Handle all tool outputs and errors explicitly.
- If unsure or if an error occurs, respond with:
  {{"type": "REASONING", "reasoning_type": "error_handling", "thought": "There was a failure or ambiguity."}}
  {{"type": "ERROR", "message": "Describe the issue or ambiguity here."}}
